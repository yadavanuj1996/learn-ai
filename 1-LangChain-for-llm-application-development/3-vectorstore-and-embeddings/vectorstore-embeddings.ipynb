Good morning. Welcome to CS229, the machine \\nlearning class. So what I wanna do today is just spend a little time going over the logistics \\nof the class, and then we\\'ll start to talk a bit about machine learning.  \\nBy way of introduction, my name\\'s Andrew Ng and I\\'ll be instructor for this class. And so \\nI personally work in machine learning, and I\\'ve worked on it for about 15 years now, and \\nI actually think that machine learning is the most exciting field of all the computer \\nsciences. So I\\'m actually always excited about teaching this class. Sometimes I actually \\nthink that machine learning is not only the most exciting thing in computer science, but \\nthe most exciting thing in all of human endeavor, so maybe a little bias there.  \\nI also want to introduce the TAs, who are all graduate students doing research in or \\nrelated to the machine learning and all aspects of machine learning. Paul Baumstarck \\nworks in machine learning and computer vision. Catie Chang is actually a neuroscientist \\nwho applies machine learning algorithms to try to understand the human brain. Tom Do \\nis another PhD student, works in computational biology and in sort of the basic \\nfundamentals of human learning. Zico Kolter is the head TA — he\\'s head TA two years \\nin a row now — works in machine learning a nd applies them to a bunch of robots. And \\nDaniel Ramage is — I guess he\\'s not here  — Daniel applies l earning algorithms to \\nproblems in natural language processing.  \\nSo you\\'ll get to know the TAs and me much better throughout this quarter, but just from \\nthe sorts of things the TA\\'s do, I hope you can already tell that machine learning is a \\nhighly interdisciplinary topic in which just the TAs find learning algorithms to problems \\nin computer vision and biology and robots and language. And machine learning is one of \\nthose things that has and is having a large impact on many applications.  \\nSo just in my own daily work, I actually frequently end up talking to people like \\nhelicopter pilots to biologists to people in computer systems or databases to economists \\nand sort of also an unending stream of people from industry coming to Stanford \\ninterested in applying machine learning methods to their own problems.  \\nSo yeah, this is fun. A couple of weeks ago, a student actually forwarded to me an article \\nin \"Computer World\" about the 12 IT skills that employers can\\'t say no to. So it\\'s about \\nsort of the 12 most desirable skills in all of IT and all of information technology, and \\ntopping the list was actually machine learning. So I think this is a good time to be \\nlearning this stuff and learning algorithms and having a large impact on many segments \\nof science and industry.  \\nI\\'m actually curious about something. Learning algorithms is one of the things that \\ntouches many areas of science and industries, and I\\'m just kind of curious. How many \\npeople here are computer science majors, are in the computer science department? Okay. \\nAbout half of you. How many people are from EE? Oh, okay, maybe about a fifth. How'),\n",

So as you can \\ntell from a cross-section of this class, I think we're a very diverse audience in this room, \\nand that's one of the things that makes this class fun to teach and fun to be in, I think.\"),\n",

And every time I teach this class, I can actually \\nvery confidently say that after December, no matter what you're going to do after this \\nDecember when you've sort of completed this class, you'll find the things you learn in \\nthis class very useful, and these things will be useful pretty much no matter what you end \\nup doing later in your life.  \\nSo I have more logistics to go over later, but let's say a few more words about machine \\nlearning. I feel that machine learning grew out of early work in AI, early work in artificial \\nintelligence. And over the last — I wanna say last 15 or last 20 years or so, it's been \\nviewed as a sort of growing new capability for computers. And in particular, it turns out \\nthat there are many programs or there are many applications that you can't program by \\nhand.  \\nFor example, if you want to get a computer to read handwritten characters, to read sort of \\nhandwritten digits, that actually turns out to be amazingly difficult to write a piece of \\nsoftware to take this input, an image of something that I wrote and to figure out just what \\nit is, to translate my cursive handwriting into — to extract the characters I wrote out in \\nlonghand. And other things: One thing that my students and I do is autonomous flight. It \\nturns out to be extremely difficult to sit down and write a program to fly a helicopter.  \\nBut in contrast, if you want to do things like to get software to fly a helicopter or have \\nsoftware recognize handwritten digits, one very successful approach is to use a learning \\nalgorithm and have a computer learn by itself how to, say, recognize your handwriting. \\nAnd in fact, handwritten digit recognition, this is pretty much the only approach that \\nworks well. It uses applications that are hard to program by hand.  \\nLearning algorithms has also made I guess significant inroads in what's sometimes called \\ndatabase mining. So, for example, with the growth of IT and computers, increasingly \\nmany hospitals are keeping around medical records of what sort of patients, what \\nproblems they had, what their prognoses was, what the outcome was. And taking all of \\nthese medical records, which started to be digitized only about maybe 15 years, applying \\nlearning algorithms to them can turn raw medical records into what I might loosely call \\nmedical knowledge in which we start to detect trends in medical practice and even start to \\nalter medical practice as a result of medical knowledge that's derived by applying \\nlearning algorithms to the sorts of medical records that hospitals have just been building \\nover the last 15, 20 years in an electronic format.  \\nTurns out that most of you probably use learning algorithms — I don't know — I think \\nhalf a dozen times a day or maybe a dozen times a day or more, and often without \\nknowing it. So, for example, every time you send mail via the US Postal System, turns \\nout there's an algorithm that tries to automatically read the zip code you wrote on your \\nenvelope, and that's done by a learning algorithm. So every time you send US mail, you \\nare using a learning algorithm, perhaps without even being aware of it.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)', 'creator': 'PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2', 'creationdate': '2008-07-11T11:25:23-07:00', 'author': '', 'moddate': '2008-07-11T11:25:23-07:00', 'title': '', 'source': '../docs/MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf', 'total_pages': 22, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content=\"Similarly, every time you write a check, I actually don't know the number for this, but a \\nsignificant fraction of checks that you write are processed by a learning algorithm that's \\nlearned to read the digits, so the dollar amount that you wrote down on your check. So \\nevery time you write a check, there's another learning algorithm that you're probably \\nusing without even being aware of it.  \\nIf you use a credit card, or I know at least one phone company was doing this, and lots of \\ncompanies like eBay as well that do electronic transactions, there's a good chance that \\nthere's a learning algorithm in the background trying to figure out if, say, your credit \\ncard's been stolen or if someone's engaging in a fraudulent transaction.  \\nIf you use a website like Amazon or Netflix that will often recommend books for you to \\nbuy or movies for you to rent or whatever, these are other examples of learning \\nalgorithms that have learned what sorts of things you like to buy or what sorts of movies \\nyou like to watch and can therefore give customized recommendations to you.  \\nJust about a week ago, I had my car serviced, and even there, my car mechanic was trying \\nto explain to me some learning algorithm in the innards of my car that's sort of doing its \\nbest to optimize my driving performance for fuel efficiency or something.  \\nSo, see, most of us use learning algorithms half a dozen, a dozen, maybe dozens of times \\nwithout even knowing it.  \\nAnd of course, learning algorithms are also doing things like giving us a growing \\nunderstanding of the human genome. So if someday we ever find a cure for cancer, I bet \\nlearning algorithms will have had a large role in that. That's sort of the thing that Tom \\nworks on, yes?  \\nSo in teaching this class, I sort of have three goals. One of them is just to I hope convey \\nsome of my own excitement about machine learning to you.  \\nThe second goal is by the end of this class, I hope all of you will be able to apply state-of-\\nthe-art machine learning algorithms to whatever problems you're interested in. And if you \\never need to build a system for reading zip codes, you'll know how to do that by the end \\nof this class.  \\nAnd lastly, by the end of this class, I realize that only a subset of you are interested in \\ndoing research in machine learning, but by the conclusion of this class, I hope that all of \\nyou will actually be well qualified to start doing research in machine learning, okay?  \\nSo let's say a few words about logistics. The prerequisites of this class are written on one \\nof the handouts, are as follows: In this class, I'm going to assume that all of you have sort \\nof basic knowledge of computer science and knowledge of the basic computer skills and \\nprinciples. So I assume all of you know what big?O notation, that all of you know about \\nsort of data structures like queues, stacks, binary trees, and that all of you know enough \\nprogramming skills to, like, write a simple computer program. And it turns out that most\"),\n",

I'll say a bit more about that later.  \\nI also assume familiarity with basic probability and statistics. So most undergraduate \\nstatistics class, like Stat 116 taught here at Stanford, will be more than enough. I'm gonna \\nassume all of you know what random variables are, that all of you know what expectation \\nis, what a variance or a random variable is. And in case of some of you, it's been a while \\nsince you've seen some of this material. At some of the discussion sections, we'll actually \\ngo over some of the prerequisites, sort of as a refresher course under prerequisite class. \\nI'll say a bit more about that later as well.  \\nLastly, I also assume familiarity with basic linear algebra. And again, most undergraduate \\nlinear algebra courses are more than enough. So if you've taken courses like Math 51, \\n103, Math 113 or CS205 at Stanford, that would be more than enough. Basically, I'm \\ngonna assume that all of you know what matrixes and vectors are, that you know how to \\nmultiply matrices and vectors and multiply matrix and matrices, that you know what a \\nmatrix inverse is. If you know what an eigenvector of a matrix is, that'd be even better. \\nBut if you don't quite know or if you're not quite sure, that's fine, too. We'll go over it in \\nthe review sections.  \\nSo there are a couple more logistical things I should deal with in this class. One is that, as \\nmost of you know, CS229 is a televised class. And in fact, I guess many of you are \\nprobably watching this at home on TV, so I'm gonna say hi to our home viewers.  \\nSo earlier this year, I approached SCPD, which televises these classes, about trying to \\nmake a small number of Stanford classes publicly available or posting the videos on the \\nweb. And so this year, Stanford is actually starting a small pilot program in which we'll \\npost videos of a small number of classes online, so on the Internet in a way that makes it \\npublicly accessible to everyone. I'm very excited about that because machine learning in \\nschool, let's get the word out there.  \\nOne of the consequences of this is that — let's see — so videos  or pictures of the students \\nin this classroom will not be posted online, so your images — so don't worry about being \\nby seeing your own face appear on YouTube one day. But the microphones may pick up \\nyour voices, so I guess the consequence of that is that because microphones may pick up \\nyour voices, no matter how irritated you are at me, don't yell out swear words in the \\nmiddle of class, but because there won't be video you can safely sit there and make faces \\nat me, and that won't show, okay?  \\nLet's see. I also handed out this — ther e were two handouts I hope most of you have, \\ncourse information handout. So let me just say a few words about parts of these. On the \\nthird page, there's a section that says Online Resources.  \\nOh, okay. Louder? Actually, could you turn up the volume? Testing. Is this better? \\nTesting, testing. Okay, cool. Thanks.\"),\n",

The class has a home page, so it's in on the handouts. I \\nwon't write on the chalkboard — http:// cs229.stanford.edu. And so when there are \\nhomework assignments or things like that, we usually won't sort of — in the mission of \\nsaving trees, we will usually not give out many handouts in class. So homework \\nassignments, homework solutions will be posted online at the course home page.  \\nAs far as this class, I've also written, and I guess I've also revised every year a set of \\nfairly detailed lecture notes that cover the technical content of this class. And so if you \\nvisit the course homepage, you'll also find the detailed lecture notes that go over in detail \\nall the math and equations and so on that I'll be doing in class.  \\nThere's also a newsgroup, su.class.cs229, also written on the handout. This is a \\nnewsgroup that's sort of a forum for people in the class to get to know each other and \\nhave whatever discussions you want to have amongst yourselves. So the class newsgroup \\nwill not be monitored by the TAs and me. But this is a place for you to form study groups \\nor find project partners or discuss homework problems and so on, and it's not monitored \\nby the TAs and me. So feel free to talk trash about this class there.  \\nIf you want to contact the teaching staff, please use the email address written down here, \\ncs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu. This goes to an account that's read by all the TAs and me. So \\nrather than sending us email individually, if you send email to this account, it will \\nactually let us get back to you maximally quickly with answers to your questions.  \\nIf you're asking questions about homework problems, please say in the subject line which \\nassignment and which question the email refers to, since that will also help us to route \\nyour question to the appropriate TA or to me appropriately and get the response back to \\nyou quickly.  \\nLet's see. Skipping ahead — let's see — for homework, one midterm, one open and term \\nproject. Notice on the honor code. So one thing that I think will help you to succeed and \\ndo well in this class and even help you to enjoy this class more is if you form a study \\ngroup.  \\nSo start looking around where you're sitting now or at the end of class today, mingle a \\nlittle bit and get to know your classmates. I strongly encourage you to form study groups \\nand sort of have a group of people to study with and have a group of your fellow students \\nto talk over these concepts with. You can also post on the class newsgroup if you want to \\nuse that to try to form a study group.  \\nBut some of the problems sets in this class are reasonably difficult. People that have \\ntaken the class before may tell you they were very difficult. And just I bet it would be \\nmore fun for you, and you'd probably have a better learning experience if you form a \\nstudy group of people to work with. So I definitely encourage you to do that.  \\nAnd just to say a word on the honor code, which is I definitely encourage you to form a \\nstudy group and work together, discuss homework problems together.

And obviously, \\nshowing your solutions to others or copying other solutions directly is right out.  \\nWe occasionally also reuse problem set questions from previous years so that the \\nproblems are a bit more debugged and work more smoothly. And as a result of that, I also \\nask you not to look at solutions from previous years, and this includes both sort of official \\nsolutions that we've given out to previous generations of this class and previous solutions \\nthat people that have taken this class in previous years may have written out by \\nthemselves, okay?  \\nSadly, in this class, there are usually — sadly, in previous y ears, there have often been a \\nfew honor code violations in this class. And last year, I think I prosecuted five honor code \\nviolations, which I think is a ridiculously large number. And so just don't work without \\nsolutions, and hopefully there'll be zero honor code violations this year. I'd love for that \\nto happen.  \\nThe section here on the late homework policy if you ever want to hand in a homework \\nlate, I'll leave you to read that yourself.  \\nWe also have a midterm, which is scheduled for Thursday, 8th of November at 6:00 p.m., \\nso please keep that evening free.  \\nAnd let's see. And one more administrative thing I wanted to say is about the class \\nproject. So part of the goal of this class is to leave you well equipped to apply machine \\nlearning algorithms to a problem or to do research in machine learning. And so as part of \\nthis class, I'll ask you to execute a small research project sort of as a small term project.  \\nAnd what most students do for this is either apply machine learning to a problem that you \\nfind interesting or investigate some aspect of machine learning. So to those of you that \\nare either already doing research or to those of you who are in industry, you're taking this \\nfrom a company, one fantastic sort of way to do a class project would be if you apply \\nmachine learning algorithms to a problem that you're interested in, to a problem that \\nyou're already working on, whether it be a science research problem or sort of a problem \\nin industry where you're trying to get a system to work using a learning algorithm.  \\nTo those of you that are not currently doing research, one great way to do a project would \\nbe if you apply learning algorithms to just pick a problem that you care about. Pick a \\nproblem that you find interesting, and apply learning algorithms to that and play with the \\nideas and see what happens.\"),\n",

And so I'm holding the list in my hand. You can go home later and \\ntake a look at it online.  \\nBut reading down this list, I see that last year, there were students that applied learning \\nalgorithms to control a snake robot. There was a few projects on improving learning \\nalgorithms. There's a project on flying autonomous aircraft. There was a project actually \\ndone by our TA Paul on improving computer vision algorithms using machine learning.  \\nThere are a couple of projects on Netflix rankings using learning algorithms; a few \\nmedical robots; ones on segmenting [inaudible] to segmenting pieces of the body using \\nlearning algorithms; one on musical instrument detection; another on irony sequence \\nalignment; and a few algorithms on understanding the brain neuroscience, actually quite a \\nfew projects on neuroscience; a couple of projects on undescending fMRI data on brain \\nscans, and so on; another project on market makings, the financial trading. There was an \\ninteresting project on trying to use learning algorithms to decide what is it that makes a \\nperson's face physically attractive. There's a learning algorithm on optical illusions, and \\nso on.  \\nAnd it goes on, so lots of fun projects. And take a look, then come up with your own \\nideas. But whatever you find cool and interesting, I hope you'll be able to make machine \\nlearning a project out of it. Yeah, question?  \\nStudent : Are these group projects?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng): Oh, yes, thank you.  \\nStudent : So how many people can be in a group?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng): Right. So projects can be done in groups of up to three people. \\nSo as part of forming study groups, later today as you get to know your classmates, I \\ndefinitely also encourage you to grab two other people and form a group of up to three \\npeople for your project, okay? And just start brainstorming ideas for now amongst \\nyourselves. You can also come and talk to me or the TAs if you want to brainstorm ideas \\nwith us.  \\nOkay.

And it\\'s helped me make lots of money, and here\\'s a \\npicture of my big house.\"  \\nSo my friend was very excited. He said, \"Wow. That\\'s great. I\\'m glad to hear this \\nmachine learning stuff was actually useful. So what was it that you learned? Was it \\nlogistic regression? Was it the PCA? Was it the data networks? What was it that you \\nlearned that was so helpful?\" And the student said, \"Oh, it was the MATLAB.\"  \\nSo for those of you that don\\'t know MATLAB yet, I hope you do learn it. It\\'s not hard, \\nand we\\'ll actually have a short MATLAB tutorial in one of the discussion sections for \\nthose of you that don\\'t know it.  \\nOkay. The very last piece of logistical thing is the discussion sections. So discussion \\nsections will be taught by the TAs, and attendance at discussion sections is optional, \\nalthough they\\'ll also be recorded and televised. And we\\'ll use the discussion sections \\nmainly for two things. For the next two or three weeks, we\\'ll use the discussion sections \\nto go over the prerequisites to this class or if some of you haven\\'t seen probability or \\nstatistics for a while or maybe algebra, we\\'ll go over those in the discussion sections as a \\nrefresher for those of you that want one.  \\nLater in this quarter, we\\'ll also use the discussion sections to go over extensions for the \\nmaterial that I\\'m teaching in the main lectures. So machine learning is a huge field, and \\nthere are a few extensions that we really want to teach but didn\\'t have time in the main \\nlectures for.'),\n",

Yeah?  \\nStudent : [Inaudible] R or something like that?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Oh, yeah, let's see, right. So our policy has been that you're \\nwelcome to use R, but I would strongly advise against it, mainly because in the last \\nproblem set, we actually supply some code that will run in Octave but that would be \\nsomewhat painful for you to translate into R yourself. So for your other assignments, if \\nyou wanna submit a solution in R, that's fine. But I think MATLAB is actually totally \\nworth learning. I know R and MATLAB, and I personally end up using MATLAB quite a \\nbit more often for various reasons. Yeah?  \\nStudent : For the [inaudible] project [inaudible]?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : So for the term project, you're welcome to do it in smaller \\ngroups of three, or you're welcome to do it by yourself or in groups of two. Grading is the \\nsame regardless of the group size, so with a larger group, you probably — I recommend \\ntrying to form a team, but it's actually totally fine to do it in a smaller group if you want.  \\nStudent : [Inaudible] what language [inaudible]?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng): So let's see. There is no C programming in this class other \\nthan any that you may choose to do yourself in your project. So all the homeworks can be \\ndone in MATLAB or Octave, and let's see. And I guess the program prerequisites is more \\nthe ability to understand big?O notation and knowledge of what a data structure, like a \\nlinked list or a queue or binary treatments, more so than your knowledge of C or Java \\nspecifically. Yeah?  \\nStudent : Looking at the end semester project, I mean, what exactly will you be testing \\nover there? [Inaudible]?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Of the project?  \\nStudent : Yeah.  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Yeah, let me answer that later.

That\\'s probably \\nthe most common project. Some students will try to improve state-of-the-art machine \\nlearning. Some of those projects are also very successful. It\\'s a little bit harder to do. And \\nthere\\'s also a smaller minority of students that will sometimes try to prove — develop the \\ntheory of machine learning further or try to prove theorems about machine learning. So \\nthey\\'re usually great projects of all of those types with applications and machine learning \\nbeing the most common. Anything else? Okay, cool.  \\nSo that was it for logistics. Let\\'s talk about learning algorithms. So can I have the laptop \\ndisplay, please, or the projector? Actually, could you lower the big screen? Cool. This is \\namazing customer service. Thank you. I see. Okay, cool. Okay. No, that\\'s fine. I see. \\nOkay. That\\'s cool. Thanks. Okay.  \\nBig screen isn\\'t working today, but I hope you can read things on the smaller screens out \\nthere. Actually, [inaudible] I think this room just got a new projector that — someone \\nsent you an excited email — was it just on Frid ay? — saying we just got a new projector \\nand they said 4,000-to-1 something or other brightness ratio. I don\\'t know. Someone was \\nvery excited about the new projector in this room, but I guess we\\'ll see that in operation \\non Wednesday.  \\nSo start by talking about what machine learning is. What is machine learning? Actually, \\ncan you read the text out there? Raise your hand if the text on the small screens is legible. \\nOh, okay, cool, mostly legible. Okay. So I\\'ll just read it out.  \\nSo what is machine learning? Way back in about 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine \\nlearning informally as the [inaudible] that gives computers to learn — [inaudible] that \\ngives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. So Arthur \\nSamuel, so way back in the history of machine learning, actually did something very \\ncool, which was he wrote a checkers program, which would play games of checkers \\nagainst itself.  \\nAnd so because a computer can play thousands of games against itself relatively quickly, \\nArthur Samuel had his program play thousands of games against itself, and over time it \\nwould start to learn to recognize patterns which led to wins and patterns which led to \\nlosses. So over time it learned things like that, \"Gee, if I get a lot of pieces taken by the \\nopponent, then I\\'m more likely to lose than win,\" or, \"Gee, if I get my pieces into a \\ncertain position, then I\\'m especially likely to win rather than lose.\"  \\nAnd so over time, Arthur Samuel had a checkers program that would actually learn to \\nplay checkers by learning what are the sort of board positions that tend to be associated \\nwith wins and what are the board positions that tend to be associated with losses. And \\nway back around 1959, the amazing thing about this was that his program actually \\nlearned to play checkers much better than Arthur Samuel himself could.'),\n",

And Arthur Samuel's checkers program was maybe \\nthe first I think really convincing refutation of this claim. Namely, Arthur Samuel \\nmanaged to write a checkers program that could play checkers much better than he \\npersonally could, and this is an instance of maybe computers learning to do things that \\nthey were not programmed explicitly to do.  \\nHere's a more recent, a more modern, more formal definition of machine learning due to \\nTom Mitchell, who says that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows: He \\nsays that a computer program is set to learn from an experience E with respect to some \\ntask T and some performance measure P if its performance on T as measured by P \\nimproves with experience E. Okay. So not only is it a definition, it even rhymes.  \\nSo, for example, in the case of checkers, the experience E that a program has would be \\nthe experience of playing lots of games of checkers against itself, say. The task T is the \\ntask of playing checkers, and the performance measure P will be something like the \\nfraction of games it wins against a certain set of human opponents. And by this \\ndefinition, we'll say that Arthur Samuel's checkers program has learned to play checkers, \\nokay?  \\nSo as an overview of what we're going to do in this class, this class is sort of organized \\ninto four major sections. We're gonna talk about four major topics in this class, the first \\nof which is supervised learning. So let me give you an example of that.  \\nSo suppose you collect a data set of housing prices. And one of the TAs, Dan Ramage, \\nactually collected a data set for me last week to use in the example later. But suppose that \\nyou go to collect statistics about how much houses cost in a certain geographic area. And \\nDan, the TA, collected data from housing prices in Portland, Oregon. So what you can do \\nis let's say plot the square footage of the house against the list price of the house, right, so \\nyou collect data on a bunch of houses. And let's say you get a data set like this with \\nhouses of different sizes that are listed for different amounts of money.  \\nNow, let's say that I'm trying to sell a house in the same area as Portland, Oregon as \\nwhere the data comes from. Let's say I have a house that's this size in square footage, and \\nI want an algorithm to tell me about how much should I expect my house to sell for. So \\nthere are lots of ways to do this, and some of you may have seen elements of what I'm \\nabout to say before.  \\nSo one thing you could do is look at this data and maybe put a straight line to it. And then \\nif this is my house, you may then look at the straight line and predict that my house is \\ngonna go for about that much money, right? There are other decisions that we can make, \\nwhich we'll talk about later, which is, well, what if I don't wanna put a straight line? \\nMaybe I should put a quadratic function to it. Maybe that fits the data a little bit better. \\nYou notice if you do that, the price of my house goes up a bit, so that'd be nice.\"),\n",

And the reason that it\\'s called supervised \\nlearning is because we\\'re providing the algorithm a data set of a bunch of square \\nfootages, a bunch of housing sizes, and as well as sort of the right answer of what the \\nactual prices of a number of houses were, right?  \\nSo we call this supervised learning because we\\'re supervising the algorithm or, in other \\nwords, we\\'re giving the algorithm the, quote, right answer for a number of houses. And \\nthen we want the algorithm to learn the association between the inputs and the outputs \\nand to sort of give us more of the right answers, okay?  \\nIt turns out this specific example that I drew here is an example of something called a \\nregression problem. And the term regression sort of refers to the fact that the variable \\nyou\\'re trying to predict is a continuous value and price.  \\nThere\\'s another class of supervised learning problems which we\\'ll talk about, which are \\nclassification problems. And so, in a classification problem, the variable you\\'re trying to \\npredict is discreet rather than continuous. So as one specific example — so actually a \\nstandard data set you can download online [inaudible] that lots of machine learning \\npeople have played with. Let\\'s say you collect a data set on breast cancer tumors, and you \\nwant to learn the algorithm to predict whether or not a certain tumor is malignant. \\nMalignant is the opposite of benign, right, so malignancy is a sort of harmful, bad tumor. \\nSo we collect some number of features, some number of properties of these tumors, and \\nfor the sake of sort of having a simple [inaudible] explanation, let\\'s just say that we\\'re \\ngoing to look at the size of the tumor and depending on the size of the tumor, we\\'ll try to \\nfigure out whether or not the tumor is malignant or benign.  \\nSo the tumor is either malignant or benign, and so the variable in the Y axis is either zero \\nor 1, and so your data set may look something like that, right? And that\\'s 1 and that\\'s \\nzero, okay? And so this is an example of a classification problem where the variable \\nyou\\'re trying to predict is a discreet value. It\\'s either zero or 1.  \\nAnd in fact, more generally, there will be many learning problems where we\\'ll have more \\nthan one input variable, more than one input feature and use more than one variable to try \\nto predict, say, whether a tumor is malignant or benign. So, for example, continuing with \\nthis, you may instead have a data set that looks like this. I\\'m gonna part this data set in a \\nslightly different way now. And I\\'m making this data set look much cleaner than it really \\nis in reality for illustration, okay?  \\nFor example, maybe the crosses indicate malignant tumors and the \"O\"s may indicate \\nbenign tumors. And so you may have a data set comprising patients of different ages and \\nwho have different tumor sizes and where a cross indicates a malignant tumor, and an \\n\"O\" indicates a benign tumor. And you may want an algorithm to learn to predict, given a \\nnew patient, whether their tumor is malignant or benign.'),\n",

So this is just another example of \\nanother supervised learning problem and another classification problem.  \\nAnd so it turns out that one of the issues we'll talk about later in this class is in this \\nspecific example, we're going to try to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign \\nbased on two features or based on two inputs, namely the age of the patient and the tumor \\nsize. It turns out that when you look at a real data set, you find that learning algorithms \\noften use other sets of features. In the breast cancer data example, you also use properties \\nof the tumors, like clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, \\n[inaudible] adhesion and so on, so various other medical properties.  \\nAnd one of the most interesting things we'll talk about later this quarter is what if your \\ndata doesn't lie in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional or sort of even a finite \\ndimensional space, but is it possible — what if your data actually lies in an infinite \\ndimensional space? Our plots here are two-dimensional space. I can't plot you an infinite \\ndimensional space, right? And so it turns out that one of the most successful classes of \\nmachine learning algorithms — some may call support vector machines — actually takes \\ndata and maps data to an infinite dimensional space and then does classification using not \\ntwo features like I've done here, but an infinite number of features.  \\nAnd that will actually be one of the most fascinating things we talk about when we go \\ndeeply into classification algorithms. And it's actually an interesting question, right, so \\nthink about how do you even represent an infinite dimensional vector in computer \\nmemory? You don't have an infinite amount of computers. How do you even represent a \\npoint that lies in an infinite dimensional space? We'll talk about that when we get to \\nsupport vector machines, okay?  \\nSo let's see. So that was supervised learning. The second of the four major topics of this \\nclass will be learning theory. So I have a friend who teaches math at a different \\nuniversity, not at Stanford, and when you talk to him about his work and what he's really \\nout to do, this friend of mine will — he's a ma th professor, right? — this friend of mine \\nwill sort of get the look of wonder in his eyes, and he'll tell you about how in his \\nmathematical work, he feels like he's discovering truth and beauty in the universe. And \\nhe says it in sort of a really touching, sincere way, and then he has this — you can see it \\nin his eyes — he has this deep appreciation of the truth and beauty in the universe as \\nrevealed to him by the math he does.  \\nIn this class, I'm not gonna do any truth and beauty. In this class, I'm gonna talk about \\nlearning theory to try to convey to you an understanding of how and why learning \\nalgorithms work so that we can apply these learning algorithms as effectively as possible.  \\nSo, for example, it turns out you can prove surprisingly deep theorems on when you can \\nguarantee that a learning algorithm will work, all right?

When can you prove a theorem guaranteeing that a \\nlearning algorithm will be at least 99.9 percent accurate on reading zip codes? This is \\nactually somewhat surprising. We actually prove theorems showing when you can expect \\nthat to hold.  \\nWe'll also sort of delve into learning theory to try to understand what algorithms can \\napproximate different functions well and also try to understand things like how much \\ntraining data do you need? So how many examples of houses do I need in order for your \\nlearning algorithm to recognize the pattern between the square footage of a house and its \\nhousing price? And this will help us answer questions like if you're trying to design a \\nlearning algorithm, should you be spending more time collecting more data or is it a case \\nthat you already have enough data; it would be a waste of time to try to collect more. \\nOkay?  \\nSo I think learning algorithms are a very powerful tool that as I walk around sort of \\nindustry in Silicon Valley or as I work with various businesses in CS and outside CS, I \\nfind that there's often a huge difference between how well someone who really \\nunderstands this stuff can apply a learning algorithm versus someone who sort of gets it \\nbut sort of doesn't.  \\nThe analogy I like to think of is imagine you were going to a carpentry school instead of \\na machine learning class, right? If you go to a carpentry school, they can give you the \\ntools of carpentry. They'll give you a hammer, a bunch of nails, a screwdriver or \\nwhatever. But a master carpenter will be able to use those tools far better than most of us \\nin this room. I know a carpenter can do things with a hammer and nail that I couldn't \\npossibly. And it's actually a little bit like that in machine learning, too. One thing that's \\nsadly not taught in many courses on machine learning is how to take the tools of machine \\nlearning and really, really apply them well.  \\nSo in the same way, so the tools of machine learning are I wanna say quite a bit more \\nadvanced than the tools of carpentry. Maybe a carpenter will disagree. But a large part of \\nthis class will be just giving you the raw tools of machine learning, just the algorithms \\nand so on. But what I plan to do throughout this entire quarter, not just in the segment of \\nlearning theory, but actually as a theme running through everything I do this quarter, will \\nbe to try to convey to you the skills to really take the learning algorithm ideas and really \\nto get them to work on a problem.  \\nIt's sort of hard for me to stand here and say how big a deal that is, but when I walk \\naround companies in Silicon Valley, it's completely not uncommon for me to see \\nsomeone using some machine learning algorithm and then explain to me what they've \\nbeen doing for the last six months, and I go, oh, gee, it should have been obvious from \\nthe start that the last six months, you've been wasting your time, right?  \\nAnd so my goal in this class, running through the entire quarter, not just on learning \\ntheory, is actually not only to give you the tools of machine learning, but to teach you \\nhow to use them well.

And this is something I\\'m really convinced is a huge deal, and so by the \\nend of this class, I hope all of you will be master carpenters. I hope all of you will be \\nreally good at applying these learning algorithms and getting them to work amazingly \\nwell in many problems. Okay?  \\nLet\\'s see. So [inaudible] the board. After learning theory, there\\'s another class of learning \\nalgorithms that I then want to teach you about, and that\\'s unsupervised learning. So you \\nrecall, right, a little earlier I drew an example like this, right, where you have a couple of \\nfeatures, a couple of input variables and sort of malignant tumors and benign tumors or \\nwhatever. And that was an example of a supervised learning problem because the data \\nyou have gives you the right answer for each of your patients. The data tells you this \\npatient has a malignant tumor; this patient has a benign tumor. So it had the right \\nanswers, and you wanted the algorithm to just produce more of the same.  \\nIn contrast, in an unsupervised learning problem, this is the sort of data you get, okay? \\nWhere speaking loosely, you\\'re given a data set, and I\\'m not gonna tell you what the right \\nanswer is on any of your data. I\\'m just gonna give you a data set and I\\'m gonna say, \\n\"Would you please find interesting structure in this data set?\" So that\\'s the unsupervised \\nlearning problem where you\\'re sort of not given the right answer for everything.  \\nSo, for example, an algorithm may find structure in the data in the form of the data being \\npartitioned into two clusters, or clustering is sort of one example of an unsupervised \\nlearning problem.  \\nSo I hope you can see this. It turns out that these sort of unsupervised learning algorithms \\nare also used in many problems. This is a screen shot — this is a picture I got from Sue \\nEmvee, who\\'s a PhD student here, who is applying unsupervised learning algorithms to \\ntry to understand gene data, so is trying to look at genes as individuals and group them \\ninto clusters based on properties of what genes they respond to — based on properties of \\nhow the genes respond to different experiments.  \\nAnother interesting application of [inaudible] sorts of clustering algorithms is actually \\nimage processing, this which I got from Steve Gules, who\\'s another PhD student. It turns \\nout what you can do is if you give this sort of data, say an image, to certain unsupervised \\nlearning algorithms, they will then learn to group pixels together and say, gee, this sort of \\npixel seems to belong together, and that sort of pixel seems to belong together.  \\nAnd so the images you see on the bottom — I guess you can just barely see them on there \\n— so the images you see on the bottom are groupings — are what the algorithm has done \\nto group certain pixels together. On a small display, it might be easier to just look at the \\nimage on the right. The two images on the bottom are two sort of identical visualizations \\nof the same grouping of the pixels into [inaudible] regions.  \\nAnd so it turns out that this sort of clustering algorithm or this sort of unsupervised \\nlearning algorithm, which learns to group pixels together, it turns out to be useful for \\nmany applications in vision, in computer vision image processing.'),\n",

This is actually a \\npicture taken of the Stanford campus. You can apply that sort of clustering algorithm and \\ngroup the picture into regions. Let me actually blow that up so that you can see it more \\nclearly. Okay. So in the middle, you see the lines sort of grouping the image together, \\ngrouping the image into [inaudible] regions.  \\nAnd what Ashutosh and Min did was they then applied the learning algorithm to say can \\nwe take this clustering and use it to build a 3D model of the world? And so using the \\nclustering, they then had a learning algorithm try to learn what the 3D structure of the \\nworld looks like so that they could come up with a 3D model that you can sort of fly \\nthrough, okay? Although many people used to think it's not possible to take a single \\nimage and build a 3D model, but using a learning algorithm and that sort of clustering \\nalgorithm is the first step. They were able to.  \\nI'll just show you one more example. I like this because it's a picture of Stanford with our \\nbeautiful Stanford campus. So again, taking the same sort of clustering algorithms, taking \\nthe same sort of unsupervised learning algorithm, you can group the pixels into different \\nregions. And using that as a pre-processing step, they eventually built this sort of 3D \\nmodel of Stanford campus in a single picture. You can sort of walk into the ceiling, look \\naround the campus. Okay? This actually turned out to be a mix of supervised and \\nunsupervised learning, but the unsupervised learning, this sort of clustering was the first \\nstep.  \\nSo it turns out these sorts of unsupervised — clustering algorithms are actually routinely \\nused for many different problems, things like organizing computing clusters, social \\nnetwork analysis, market segmentation, so if you're a marketer and you want to divide \\nyour market into different segments or different groups of people to market to them \\nseparately; even for astronomical data analysis and understanding how galaxies are \\nformed. These are just a sort of small sample of the applications of unsupervised learning \\nalgorithms and clustering algorithms that we'll talk about later in this class.  \\nJust one particularly cool example of an unsupervised learning algorithm that I want to \\ntell you about. And to motivate that, I'm gonna tell you about what's called the cocktail \\nparty problem, which is imagine that you're at some cocktail party and there are lots of \\npeople standing all over. And you know how it is, right, if you're at a large party, \\neveryone's talking, it can be sometimes very hard to hear even the person in front of you. \\nSo imagine a large cocktail party with lots of people. So the problem is, is that all of these \\npeople talking, can you separate out the voice of just the person you're interested in \\ntalking to with all this loud background noise?  \\nSo I'll show you a specific example in a second, but here's a cocktail party that's I guess \\nrather sparsely attended by just two people. But what we're gonna do is we'll put two \\nmicrophones in the room, okay?

So I'm gonna play some audio clips that were collected by Tai Yuan \\nLee at UCSD. I'm gonna actually play for you the original raw microphone recordings \\nfrom this cocktail party. So this is the Microphone 1:  \\nMicrophone 1:  \\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  \\nMicrophone 2:  \\nUno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis, siete, ocho, nueve, diez.  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : So it's a fascinating cocktail party with people counting from \\none to ten.

So in supervised learning, we don't know what the \\nright answer is, right? So what we're going to do is take exactly the two microphone \\nrecordings you just heard and give it to an unsupervised learning algorithm and tell the \\nalgorithm which of these discover structure in the data [inaudible] or what structure is \\nthere in this data? And we actually don't know what the right answer is offhand.  \\nSo give this data to an unsupervised learning algorithm, and what the algorithm does in \\nthis case, it will discover that this data can actually be explained by two independent \\nspeakers speaking at the same time, and it can further separate out the two speakers for \\nyou. So here's Output 1 of the algorithm:  \\nMicrophone 1:  \\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : And there's the second algorithm:  \\nMicrophone 2:\"),\n",

This is a, well, this is a second sort of different pair of \\nmicrophone recordings:  \\nMicrophone 1:  \\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  \\nMicrophone 2:  \\n[Music playing.]  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng): So the poor guy is not at a cocktail party.

It sounds like a pretty complicated thing to do. So you\\'re gonna ask how complicated \\nis it really to implement an algorithm like this? It turns out if you do it in MATLAB, you \\ncan do it in one line of code.  \\nSo I got this from Samuel Wyse at Toronto, U of Toronto, and the example I showed you \\nactually used a more complicated ICA algorithm than this. But nonetheless, I guess this is \\nwhy for this class I\\'m going to ask you to do most of your programming in MATLAB and \\nOctave because if you try to implement the same algorithm in C or Java or something, I \\ncan tell you from personal, painful experience, you end up writing pages and pages of \\ncode rather than relatively few lines of code. I\\'ll also mention that it did take researchers \\nmany, many years to come up with that one line of code, so this is not easy.  \\nSo that was unsupervised learning, and then the last of the four major topics I wanna tell \\nyou about is reinforcement learning. And this refers to problems where you don\\'t do one-\\nshot decision-making. So, for example, in the supervised learning cancer prediction \\nproblem, you have a patient come in, you predict that the cancer is malignant or benign. \\nAnd then based on your prediction, maybe the patient lives or dies, and then that\\'s it, \\nright? So you make a decision and then there\\'s a consequence. You either got it right or \\nwrong. In reinforcement learning problems, you are usually asked to make a sequence of \\ndecisions over time.  \\nSo, for example, this is something that my students and I work on. If I give you the keys \\nto an autonomous helicopter — we actually ha ve this helicopter here at Stanford, — how \\ndo you write a program to make it fly, right? You notice that if you make a wrong \\ndecision on a helicopter, the consequence of crashing it may not happen until much later. \\nAnd in fact, usually you need to make a whole sequence of bad decisions to crash a \\nhelicopter. But conversely, you also need to make a whole sequence of good decisions in \\norder to fly a helicopter really well.  \\nSo I\\'m gonna show you some fun videos of learning algorithms flying helicopters. This is \\na video of our helicopter at Stanford flying using a controller that was learned using a \\nreinforcement learning algorithm. So this was done on the Stanford football field, and \\nwe\\'ll zoom out the camera in a second. You\\'ll sort of see the trees planted in the sky. So \\nmaybe this is one of the most difficult aerobatic maneuvers flown on any helicopter under \\ncomputer control. And this controller, which is very, very hard for a human to sit down \\nand write out, was learned using one of these reinforcement learning algorithms.  \\nJust a word about that: The basic idea behind a reinforcement learning algorithm is this \\nidea of what\\'s called a reward function. What we have to think about is imagine you\\'re \\ntrying to train a dog. So every time your dog does something good, you say, \"Good dog,\" \\nand you reward the dog. Every time your dog does something bad, you go, \"Bad dog,\" \\nright? And hopefully, over time, your dog will learn to do the right things to get more of \\nthe positive rewards, to get more of the \"Good dogs\" and to get fewer of the \"Bad dogs.”'),\n",

And \\nthen it\\'s up to the learning algorithm to figure out how to maximize the \"good dog\" \\nreward signals and minimize the \"bad dog\" punishments.  \\nSo it turns out reinforcement learning is applied to other problems in robotics. It\\'s applied \\nto things in web crawling and so on. But it\\'s just cool to show videos, so let me just show \\na bunch of them. This learning algorithm was actually implemented by our head TA, \\nZico, of programming a four-legged dog. I guess Sam Shriver in this class also worked \\non the project and Peter Renfrew and Mike and a few others. But I guess this really is a \\ngood dog/bad dog since it\\'s a robot dog.  \\nThe second video on the right, some of the students, I guess Peter, Zico, Tonca working \\non a robotic snake, again using learning algorithms to teach a snake robot to climb over \\nobstacles.  \\nBelow that, this is kind of a fun example. Ashutosh Saxena and Jeff Michaels used \\nlearning algorithms to teach a car how to drive at reasonably high speeds off roads \\navoiding obstacles.  \\nAnd on the lower right, that\\'s a robot programmed by PhD student Eva Roshen to teach a \\nsort of somewhat strangely configured robot how to get on top of an obstacle, how to get \\nover an obstacle. Sorry. I know the video\\'s kind of small. I hope you can sort of see it. \\nOkay?  \\nSo I think all of these are robots that I think are very difficult to hand-code a controller \\nfor by learning these sorts of learning algorithms. You can in relatively short order get a \\nrobot to do often pretty amazing things.  \\nOkay. So that was most of what I wanted to say today. Just a couple more last things, but \\nlet me just check what questions you have right now. So if there are no questions, I\\'ll just \\nclose with two reminders, which are after class today or as you start to talk with other \\npeople in this class, I just encourage you again to start to form project partners, to try to \\nfind project partners to do your project with. And also, this is a good time to start forming \\nstudy groups, so either talk to your friends or post in the newsgroup, but we just \\nencourage you to try to start to do both of those today, okay? Form study groups, and try \\nto find two other project partners.  \\nSo thank you. I\\'m looking forward to teaching this class, and I\\'ll see you in a couple of \\ndays.'),\n",

Good morning. Welcome to CS229, the machine \\nlearning class. So what I wanna do today is just spend a little time going over the logistics \\nof the class, and then we\\'ll start to talk a bit about machine learning.  \\nBy way of introduction, my name\\'s Andrew Ng and I\\'ll be instructor for this class. And so \\nI personally work in machine learning, and I\\'ve worked on it for about 15 years now, and \\nI actually think that machine learning is the most exciting field of all the computer \\nsciences. So I\\'m actually always excited about teaching this class. Sometimes I actually \\nthink that machine learning is not only the most exciting thing in computer science, but \\nthe most exciting thing in all of human endeavor, so maybe a little bias there.  \\nI also want to introduce the TAs, who are all graduate students doing research in or \\nrelated to the machine learning and all aspects of machine learning. Paul Baumstarck \\nworks in machine learning and computer vision. Catie Chang is actually a neuroscientist \\nwho applies machine learning algorithms to try to understand the human brain. Tom Do \\nis another PhD student, works in computational biology and in sort of the basic \\nfundamentals of human learning. Zico Kolter is the head TA — he\\'s head TA two years \\nin a row now — works in machine learning a nd applies them to a bunch of robots. And \\nDaniel Ramage is — I guess he\\'s not here  — Daniel applies l earning algorithms to \\nproblems in natural language processing.  \\nSo you\\'ll get to know the TAs and me much better throughout this quarter, but just from \\nthe sorts of things the TA\\'s do, I hope you can already tell that machine learning is a \\nhighly interdisciplinary topic in which just the TAs find learning algorithms to problems \\nin computer vision and biology and robots and language. And machine learning is one of \\nthose things that has and is having a large impact on many applications.  \\nSo just in my own daily work, I actually frequently end up talking to people like \\nhelicopter pilots to biologists to people in computer systems or databases to economists \\nand sort of also an unending stream of people from industry coming to Stanford \\ninterested in applying machine learning methods to their own problems.  \\nSo yeah, this is fun. A couple of weeks ago, a student actually forwarded to me an article \\nin \"Computer World\" about the 12 IT skills that employers can\\'t say no to. So it\\'s about \\nsort of the 12 most desirable skills in all of IT and all of information technology, and \\ntopping the list was actually machine learning. So I think this is a good time to be \\nlearning this stuff and learning algorithms and having a large impact on many segments \\nof science and industry.  \\nI\\'m actually curious about something. Learning algorithms is one of the things that \\ntouches many areas of science and industries, and I\\'m just kind of curious. How many \\npeople here are computer science majors, are in the computer science department? Okay. \\nAbout half of you. How many people are from EE? Oh, okay, maybe about a fifth. How'),\n",

And every time I teach this class, I can actually \\nvery confidently say that after December, no matter what you're going to do after this \\nDecember when you've sort of completed this class, you'll find the things you learn in \\nthis class very useful, and these things will be useful pretty much no matter what you end \\nup doing later in your life.  \\nSo I have more logistics to go over later, but let's say a few more words about machine \\nlearning. I feel that machine learning grew out of early work in AI, early work in artificial \\nintelligence. And over the last — I wanna say last 15 or last 20 years or so, it's been \\nviewed as a sort of growing new capability for computers. And in particular, it turns out \\nthat there are many programs or there are many applications that you can't program by \\nhand.  \\nFor example, if you want to get a computer to read handwritten characters, to read sort of \\nhandwritten digits, that actually turns out to be amazingly difficult to write a piece of \\nsoftware to take this input, an image of something that I wrote and to figure out just what \\nit is, to translate my cursive handwriting into — to extract the characters I wrote out in \\nlonghand. And other things: One thing that my students and I do is autonomous flight. It \\nturns out to be extremely difficult to sit down and write a program to fly a helicopter.  \\nBut in contrast, if you want to do things like to get software to fly a helicopter or have \\nsoftware recognize handwritten digits, one very successful approach is to use a learning \\nalgorithm and have a computer learn by itself how to, say, recognize your handwriting. \\nAnd in fact, handwritten digit recognition, this is pretty much the only approach that \\nworks well. It uses applications that are hard to program by hand.  \\nLearning algorithms has also made I guess significant inroads in what's sometimes called \\ndatabase mining. So, for example, with the growth of IT and computers, increasingly \\nmany hospitals are keeping around medical records of what sort of patients, what \\nproblems they had, what their prognoses was, what the outcome was. And taking all of \\nthese medical records, which started to be digitized only about maybe 15 years, applying \\nlearning algorithms to them can turn raw medical records into what I might loosely call \\nmedical knowledge in which we start to detect trends in medical practice and even start to \\nalter medical practice as a result of medical knowledge that's derived by applying \\nlearning algorithms to the sorts of medical records that hospitals have just been building \\nover the last 15, 20 years in an electronic format.  \\nTurns out that most of you probably use learning algorithms — I don't know — I think \\nhalf a dozen times a day or maybe a dozen times a day or more, and often without \\nknowing it. So, for example, every time you send mail via the US Postal System, turns \\nout there's an algorithm that tries to automatically read the zip code you wrote on your \\nenvelope, and that's done by a learning algorithm. So every time you send US mail, you \\nare using a learning algorithm, perhaps without even being aware of it.\"),\n",

So \\nevery time you write a check, there's another learning algorithm that you're probably \\nusing without even being aware of it.  \\nIf you use a credit card, or I know at least one phone company was doing this, and lots of \\ncompanies like eBay as well that do electronic transactions, there's a good chance that \\nthere's a learning algorithm in the background trying to figure out if, say, your credit \\ncard's been stolen or if someone's engaging in a fraudulent transaction.  \\nIf you use a website like Amazon or Netflix that will often recommend books for you to \\nbuy or movies for you to rent or whatever, these are other examples of learning \\nalgorithms that have learned what sorts of things you like to buy or what sorts of movies \\nyou like to watch and can therefore give customized recommendations to you.  \\nJust about a week ago, I had my car serviced, and even there, my car mechanic was trying \\nto explain to me some learning algorithm in the innards of my car that's sort of doing its \\nbest to optimize my driving performance for fuel efficiency or something.  \\nSo, see, most of us use learning algorithms half a dozen, a dozen, maybe dozens of times \\nwithout even knowing it.  \\nAnd of course, learning algorithms are also doing things like giving us a growing \\nunderstanding of the human genome. So if someday we ever find a cure for cancer, I bet \\nlearning algorithms will have had a large role in that. That's sort of the thing that Tom \\nworks on, yes?  \\nSo in teaching this class, I sort of have three goals. One of them is just to I hope convey \\nsome of my own excitement about machine learning to you.  \\nThe second goal is by the end of this class, I hope all of you will be able to apply state-of-\\nthe-art machine learning algorithms to whatever problems you're interested in. And if you \\never need to build a system for reading zip codes, you'll know how to do that by the end \\nof this class.  \\nAnd lastly, by the end of this class, I realize that only a subset of you are interested in \\ndoing research in machine learning, but by the conclusion of this class, I hope that all of \\nyou will actually be well qualified to start doing research in machine learning, okay?  \\nSo let's say a few words about logistics. The prerequisites of this class are written on one \\nof the handouts, are as follows: In this class, I'm going to assume that all of you have sort \\nof basic knowledge of computer science and knowledge of the basic computer skills and \\nprinciples. So I assume all of you know what big?O notation, that all of you know about \\nsort of data structures like queues, stacks, binary trees, and that all of you know enough \\nprogramming skills to, like, write a simple computer program. And it turns out that most\"),\n",

I'll say a bit more about that later.  \\nI also assume familiarity with basic probability and statistics. So most undergraduate \\nstatistics class, like Stat 116 taught here at Stanford, will be more than enough. I'm gonna \\nassume all of you know what random variables are, that all of you know what expectation \\nis, what a variance or a random variable is. And in case of some of you, it's been a while \\nsince you've seen some of this material. At some of the discussion sections, we'll actually \\ngo over some of the prerequisites, sort of as a refresher course under prerequisite class. \\nI'll say a bit more about that later as well.  \\nLastly, I also assume familiarity with basic linear algebra. And again, most undergraduate \\nlinear algebra courses are more than enough. So if you've taken courses like Math 51, \\n103, Math 113 or CS205 at Stanford, that would be more than enough. Basically, I'm \\ngonna assume that all of you know what matrixes and vectors are, that you know how to \\nmultiply matrices and vectors and multiply matrix and matrices, that you know what a \\nmatrix inverse is. If you know what an eigenvector of a matrix is, that'd be even better. \\nBut if you don't quite know or if you're not quite sure, that's fine, too. We'll go over it in \\nthe review sections.  \\nSo there are a couple more logistical things I should deal with in this class. One is that, as \\nmost of you know, CS229 is a televised class. And in fact, I guess many of you are \\nprobably watching this at home on TV, so I'm gonna say hi to our home viewers.  \\nSo earlier this year, I approached SCPD, which televises these classes, about trying to \\nmake a small number of Stanford classes publicly available or posting the videos on the \\nweb. And so this year, Stanford is actually starting a small pilot program in which we'll \\npost videos of a small number of classes online, so on the Internet in a way that makes it \\npublicly accessible to everyone. I'm very excited about that because machine learning in \\nschool, let's get the word out there.  \\nOne of the consequences of this is that — let's see — so videos  or pictures of the students \\nin this classroom will not be posted online, so your images — so don't worry about being \\nby seeing your own face appear on YouTube one day. But the microphones may pick up \\nyour voices, so I guess the consequence of that is that because microphones may pick up \\nyour voices, no matter how irritated you are at me, don't yell out swear words in the \\nmiddle of class, but because there won't be video you can safely sit there and make faces \\nat me, and that won't show, okay?  \\nLet's see. I also handed out this — ther e were two handouts I hope most of you have, \\ncourse information handout. So let me just say a few words about parts of these. On the \\nthird page, there's a section that says Online Resources.  \\nOh, okay. Louder? Actually, could you turn up the volume? Testing. Is this better? \\nTesting, testing. Okay, cool.

But this is a place for you to form study groups \\nor find project partners or discuss homework problems and so on, and it's not monitored \\nby the TAs and me. So feel free to talk trash about this class there.  \\nIf you want to contact the teaching staff, please use the email address written down here, \\ncs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu. This goes to an account that's read by all the TAs and me. So \\nrather than sending us email individually, if you send email to this account, it will \\nactually let us get back to you maximally quickly with answers to your questions.  \\nIf you're asking questions about homework problems, please say in the subject line which \\nassignment and which question the email refers to, since that will also help us to route \\nyour question to the appropriate TA or to me appropriately and get the response back to \\nyou quickly.  \\nLet's see. Skipping ahead — let's see — for homework, one midterm, one open and term \\nproject. Notice on the honor code. So one thing that I think will help you to succeed and \\ndo well in this class and even help you to enjoy this class more is if you form a study \\ngroup.  \\nSo start looking around where you're sitting now or at the end of class today, mingle a \\nlittle bit and get to know your classmates. I strongly encourage you to form study groups \\nand sort of have a group of people to study with and have a group of your fellow students \\nto talk over these concepts with. You can also post on the class newsgroup if you want to \\nuse that to try to form a study group.  \\nBut some of the problems sets in this class are reasonably difficult. People that have \\ntaken the class before may tell you they were very difficult. And just I bet it would be \\nmore fun for you, and you'd probably have a better learning experience if you form a \\nstudy group of people to work with. So I definitely encourage you to do that.  \\nAnd just to say a word on the honor code, which is I definitely encourage you to form a \\nstudy group and work together, discuss homework problems together. But if you discuss\"),\n",

And obviously, \\nshowing your solutions to others or copying other solutions directly is right out.  \\nWe occasionally also reuse problem set questions from previous years so that the \\nproblems are a bit more debugged and work more smoothly. And as a result of that, I also \\nask you not to look at solutions from previous years, and this includes both sort of official \\nsolutions that we've given out to previous generations of this class and previous solutions \\nthat people that have taken this class in previous years may have written out by \\nthemselves, okay?  \\nSadly, in this class, there are usually — sadly, in previous y ears, there have often been a \\nfew honor code violations in this class. And last year, I think I prosecuted five honor code \\nviolations, which I think is a ridiculously large number.

And one more administrative thing I wanted to say is about the class \\nproject. So part of the goal of this class is to leave you well equipped to apply machine \\nlearning algorithms to a problem or to do research in machine learning. And so as part of \\nthis class, I'll ask you to execute a small research project sort of as a small term project.  \\nAnd what most students do for this is either apply machine learning to a problem that you \\nfind interesting or investigate some aspect of machine learning. So to those of you that \\nare either already doing research or to those of you who are in industry, you're taking this \\nfrom a company, one fantastic sort of way to do a class project would be if you apply \\nmachine learning algorithms to a problem that you're interested in, to a problem that \\nyou're already working on, whether it be a science research problem or sort of a problem \\nin industry where you're trying to get a system to work using a learning algorithm.  \\nTo those of you that are not currently doing research, one great way to do a project would \\nbe if you apply learning algorithms to just pick a problem that you care about. Pick a \\nproblem that you find interesting, and apply learning algorithms to that and play with the \\nideas and see what happens.\"),\n",

You can go home later and \\ntake a look at it online.  \\nBut reading down this list, I see that last year, there were students that applied learning \\nalgorithms to control a snake robot. There was a few projects on improving learning \\nalgorithms. There's a project on flying autonomous aircraft. There was a project actually \\ndone by our TA Paul on improving computer vision algorithms using machine learning.  \\nThere are a couple of projects on Netflix rankings using learning algorithms; a few \\nmedical robots; ones on segmenting [inaudible] to segmenting pieces of the body using \\nlearning algorithms; one on musical instrument detection; another on irony sequence \\nalignment; and a few algorithms on understanding the brain neuroscience, actually quite a \\nfew projects on neuroscience; a couple of projects on undescending fMRI data on brain \\nscans, and so on; another project on market makings, the financial trading.

He\\'s taught it for many years. \\nSo one day, he was in his office, and an old student of his from, like, ten years ago came \\ninto his office and he said, \"Oh, professor, professor, thank you so much for your \\nmachine learning class. I learned so much from it. There\\'s this stuff that I learned in your \\nclass, and I now use every day.

I\\'m glad to hear this \\nmachine learning stuff was actually useful. So what was it that you learned? Was it \\nlogistic regression? Was it the PCA? Was it the data networks? What was it that you \\nlearned that was so helpful?\" And the student said, \"Oh, it was the MATLAB.\"  \\nSo for those of you that don\\'t know MATLAB yet, I hope you do learn it.

So our policy has been that you're \\nwelcome to use R, but I would strongly advise against it, mainly because in the last \\nproblem set, we actually supply some code that will run in Octave but that would be \\nsomewhat painful for you to translate into R yourself. So for your other assignments, if \\nyou wanna submit a solution in R, that's fine. But I think MATLAB is actually totally \\nworth learning. I know R and MATLAB, and I personally end up using MATLAB quite a \\nbit more often for various reasons. Yeah?  \\nStudent : For the [inaudible] project [inaudible]?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : So for the term project, you're welcome to do it in smaller \\ngroups of three, or you're welcome to do it by yourself or in groups of two.

There is no C programming in this class other \\nthan any that you may choose to do yourself in your project. So all the homeworks can be \\ndone in MATLAB or Octave, and let's see. And I guess the program prerequisites is more \\nthe ability to understand big?O notation and knowledge of what a data structure, like a \\nlinked list or a queue or binary treatments, more so than your knowledge of C or Java \\nspecifically. Yeah?  \\nStudent : Looking at the end semester project, I mean, what exactly will you be testing \\nover there?

Way back in about 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine \\nlearning informally as the [inaudible] that gives computers to learn — [inaudible] that \\ngives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. So Arthur \\nSamuel, so way back in the history of machine learning, actually did something very \\ncool, which was he wrote a checkers program, which would play games of checkers \\nagainst itself.  \\nAnd so because a computer can play thousands of games against itself relatively quickly, \\nArthur Samuel had his program play thousands of games against itself, and over time it \\nwould start to learn to recognize patterns which led to wins and patterns which led to \\nlosses. So over time it learned things like that, \"Gee, if I get a lot of pieces taken by the \\nopponent, then I\\'m more likely to lose than win,\" or, \"Gee, if I get my pieces into a \\ncertain position, then I\\'m especially likely to win rather than lose.\"  \\nAnd so over time, Arthur Samuel had a checkers program that would actually learn to \\nplay checkers by learning what are the sort of board positions that tend to be associated \\nwith wins and what are the board positions that tend to be associated with losses. And \\nway back around 1959, the amazing thing about this was that his program actually \\nlearned to play checkers much better than Arthur Samuel himself could.'),\n",

And Arthur Samuel's checkers program was maybe \\nthe first I think really convincing refutation of this claim. Namely, Arthur Samuel \\nmanaged to write a checkers program that could play checkers much better than he \\npersonally could, and this is an instance of maybe computers learning to do things that \\nthey were not programmed explicitly to do.  \\nHere's a more recent, a more modern, more formal definition of machine learning due to \\nTom Mitchell, who says that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows: He \\nsays that a computer program is set to learn from an experience E with respect to some \\ntask T and some performance measure P if its performance on T as measured by P \\nimproves with experience E. Okay. So not only is it a definition, it even rhymes.  \\nSo, for example, in the case of checkers, the experience E that a program has would be \\nthe experience of playing lots of games of checkers against itself, say. The task T is the \\ntask of playing checkers, and the performance measure P will be something like the \\nfraction of games it wins against a certain set of human opponents. And by this \\ndefinition, we'll say that Arthur Samuel's checkers program has learned to play checkers, \\nokay?  \\nSo as an overview of what we're going to do in this class, this class is sort of organized \\ninto four major sections. We're gonna talk about four major topics in this class, the first \\nof which is supervised learning. So let me give you an example of that.  \\nSo suppose you collect a data set of housing prices. And one of the TAs, Dan Ramage, \\nactually collected a data set for me last week to use in the example later. But suppose that \\nyou go to collect statistics about how much houses cost in a certain geographic area. And \\nDan, the TA, collected data from housing prices in Portland, Oregon. So what you can do \\nis let's say plot the square footage of the house against the list price of the house, right, so \\nyou collect data on a bunch of houses. And let's say you get a data set like this with \\nhouses of different sizes that are listed for different amounts of money.  \\nNow, let's say that I'm trying to sell a house in the same area as Portland, Oregon as \\nwhere the data comes from. Let's say I have a house that's this size in square footage, and \\nI want an algorithm to tell me about how much should I expect my house to sell for. So \\nthere are lots of ways to do this, and some of you may have seen elements of what I'm \\nabout to say before.  \\nSo one thing you could do is look at this data and maybe put a straight line to it. And then \\nif this is my house, you may then look at the straight line and predict that my house is \\ngonna go for about that much money, right? There are other decisions that we can make, \\nwhich we'll talk about later, which is, well, what if I don't wanna put a straight line? \\nMaybe I should put a quadratic function to it. Maybe that fits the data a little bit better. \\nYou notice if you do that, the price of my house goes up a bit, so that'd be nice.\"),\n",

And the reason that it\\'s called supervised \\nlearning is because we\\'re providing the algorithm a data set of a bunch of square \\nfootages, a bunch of housing sizes, and as well as sort of the right answer of what the \\nactual prices of a number of houses were, right?  \\nSo we call this supervised learning because we\\'re supervising the algorithm or, in other \\nwords, we\\'re giving the algorithm the, quote, right answer for a number of houses. And \\nthen we want the algorithm to learn the association between the inputs and the outputs \\nand to sort of give us more of the right answers, okay?  \\nIt turns out this specific example that I drew here is an example of something called a \\nregression problem. And the term regression sort of refers to the fact that the variable \\nyou\\'re trying to predict is a continuous value and price.  \\nThere\\'s another class of supervised learning problems which we\\'ll talk about, which are \\nclassification problems. And so, in a classification problem, the variable you\\'re trying to \\npredict is discreet rather than continuous. So as one specific example — so actually a \\nstandard data set you can download online [inaudible] that lots of machine learning \\npeople have played with. Let\\'s say you collect a data set on breast cancer tumors, and you \\nwant to learn the algorithm to predict whether or not a certain tumor is malignant. \\nMalignant is the opposite of benign, right, so malignancy is a sort of harmful, bad tumor. \\nSo we collect some number of features, some number of properties of these tumors, and \\nfor the sake of sort of having a simple [inaudible] explanation, let\\'s just say that we\\'re \\ngoing to look at the size of the tumor and depending on the size of the tumor, we\\'ll try to \\nfigure out whether or not the tumor is malignant or benign.  \\nSo the tumor is either malignant or benign, and so the variable in the Y axis is either zero \\nor 1, and so your data set may look something like that, right? And that\\'s 1 and that\\'s \\nzero, okay? And so this is an example of a classification problem where the variable \\nyou\\'re trying to predict is a discreet value. It\\'s either zero or 1.  \\nAnd in fact, more generally, there will be many learning problems where we\\'ll have more \\nthan one input variable, more than one input feature and use more than one variable to try \\nto predict, say, whether a tumor is malignant or benign. So, for example, continuing with \\nthis, you may instead have a data set that looks like this. I\\'m gonna part this data set in a \\nslightly different way now. And I\\'m making this data set look much cleaner than it really \\nis in reality for illustration, okay?  \\nFor example, maybe the crosses indicate malignant tumors and the \"O\"s may indicate \\nbenign tumors. And so you may have a data set comprising patients of different ages and \\nwho have different tumor sizes and where a cross indicates a malignant tumor, and an \\n\"O\" indicates a benign tumor. And you may want an algorithm to learn to predict, given a \\nnew patient, whether their tumor is malignant or benign.'),\n",

So this is just another example of \\nanother supervised learning problem and another classification problem.  \\nAnd so it turns out that one of the issues we'll talk about later in this class is in this \\nspecific example, we're going to try to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign \\nbased on two features or based on two inputs, namely the age of the patient and the tumor \\nsize. It turns out that when you look at a real data set, you find that learning algorithms \\noften use other sets of features. In the breast cancer data example, you also use properties \\nof the tumors, like clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, \\n[inaudible] adhesion and so on, so various other medical properties.  \\nAnd one of the most interesting things we'll talk about later this quarter is what if your \\ndata doesn't lie in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional or sort of even a finite \\ndimensional space, but is it possible — what if your data actually lies in an infinite \\ndimensional space? Our plots here are two-dimensional space. I can't plot you an infinite \\ndimensional space, right? And so it turns out that one of the most successful classes of \\nmachine learning algorithms — some may call support vector machines — actually takes \\ndata and maps data to an infinite dimensional space and then does classification using not \\ntwo features like I've done here, but an infinite number of features.  \\nAnd that will actually be one of the most fascinating things we talk about when we go \\ndeeply into classification algorithms. And it's actually an interesting question, right, so \\nthink about how do you even represent an infinite dimensional vector in computer \\nmemory? You don't have an infinite amount of computers. How do you even represent a \\npoint that lies in an infinite dimensional space? We'll talk about that when we get to \\nsupport vector machines, okay?  \\nSo let's see. So that was supervised learning. The second of the four major topics of this \\nclass will be learning theory. So I have a friend who teaches math at a different \\nuniversity, not at Stanford, and when you talk to him about his work and what he's really \\nout to do, this friend of mine will — he's a ma th professor, right? — this friend of mine \\nwill sort of get the look of wonder in his eyes, and he'll tell you about how in his \\nmathematical work, he feels like he's discovering truth and beauty in the universe. And \\nhe says it in sort of a really touching, sincere way, and then he has this — you can see it \\nin his eyes — he has this deep appreciation of the truth and beauty in the universe as \\nrevealed to him by the math he does.  \\nIn this class, I'm not gonna do any truth and beauty. In this class, I'm gonna talk about \\nlearning theory to try to convey to you an understanding of how and why learning \\nalgorithms work so that we can apply these learning algorithms as effectively as possible.  \\nSo, for example, it turns out you can prove surprisingly deep theorems on when you can \\nguarantee that a learning algorithm will work, all right?

So how many examples of houses do I need in order for your \\nlearning algorithm to recognize the pattern between the square footage of a house and its \\nhousing price? And this will help us answer questions like if you're trying to design a \\nlearning algorithm, should you be spending more time collecting more data or is it a case \\nthat you already have enough data; it would be a waste of time to try to collect more. \\nOkay?  \\nSo I think learning algorithms are a very powerful tool that as I walk around sort of \\nindustry in Silicon Valley or as I work with various businesses in CS and outside CS, I \\nfind that there's often a huge difference between how well someone who really \\nunderstands this stuff can apply a learning algorithm versus someone who sort of gets it \\nbut sort of doesn't.  \\nThe analogy I like to think of is imagine you were going to a carpentry school instead of \\na machine learning class, right? If you go to a carpentry school, they can give you the \\ntools of carpentry. They'll give you a hammer, a bunch of nails, a screwdriver or \\nwhatever. But a master carpenter will be able to use those tools far better than most of us \\nin this room. I know a carpenter can do things with a hammer and nail that I couldn't \\npossibly. And it's actually a little bit like that in machine learning, too. One thing that's \\nsadly not taught in many courses on machine learning is how to take the tools of machine \\nlearning and really, really apply them well.  \\nSo in the same way, so the tools of machine learning are I wanna say quite a bit more \\nadvanced than the tools of carpentry. Maybe a carpenter will disagree. But a large part of \\nthis class will be just giving you the raw tools of machine learning, just the algorithms \\nand so on. But what I plan to do throughout this entire quarter, not just in the segment of \\nlearning theory, but actually as a theme running through everything I do this quarter, will \\nbe to try to convey to you the skills to really take the learning algorithm ideas and really \\nto get them to work on a problem.  \\nIt's sort of hard for me to stand here and say how big a deal that is, but when I walk \\naround companies in Silicon Valley, it's completely not uncommon for me to see \\nsomeone using some machine learning algorithm and then explain to me what they've \\nbeen doing for the last six months, and I go, oh, gee, it should have been obvious from \\nthe start that the last six months, you've been wasting your time, right?  \\nAnd so my goal in this class, running through the entire quarter, not just on learning \\ntheory, is actually not only to give you the tools of machine learning, but to teach you \\nhow to use them well. And I've noticed this is something that really not many other\"),\n",

And this is something I\\'m really convinced is a huge deal, and so by the \\nend of this class, I hope all of you will be master carpenters. I hope all of you will be \\nreally good at applying these learning algorithms and getting them to work amazingly \\nwell in many problems. Okay?  \\nLet\\'s see. So [inaudible] the board. After learning theory, there\\'s another class of learning \\nalgorithms that I then want to teach you about, and that\\'s unsupervised learning. So you \\nrecall, right, a little earlier I drew an example like this, right, where you have a couple of \\nfeatures, a couple of input variables and sort of malignant tumors and benign tumors or \\nwhatever. And that was an example of a supervised learning problem because the data \\nyou have gives you the right answer for each of your patients. The data tells you this \\npatient has a malignant tumor; this patient has a benign tumor. So it had the right \\nanswers, and you wanted the algorithm to just produce more of the same.  \\nIn contrast, in an unsupervised learning problem, this is the sort of data you get, okay? \\nWhere speaking loosely, you\\'re given a data set, and I\\'m not gonna tell you what the right \\nanswer is on any of your data. I\\'m just gonna give you a data set and I\\'m gonna say, \\n\"Would you please find interesting structure in this data set?\" So that\\'s the unsupervised \\nlearning problem where you\\'re sort of not given the right answer for everything.  \\nSo, for example, an algorithm may find structure in the data in the form of the data being \\npartitioned into two clusters, or clustering is sort of one example of an unsupervised \\nlearning problem.  \\nSo I hope you can see this. It turns out that these sort of unsupervised learning algorithms \\nare also used in many problems. This is a screen shot — this is a picture I got from Sue \\nEmvee, who\\'s a PhD student here, who is applying unsupervised learning algorithms to \\ntry to understand gene data, so is trying to look at genes as individuals and group them \\ninto clusters based on properties of what genes they respond to — based on properties of \\nhow the genes respond to different experiments.  \\nAnother interesting application of [inaudible] sorts of clustering algorithms is actually \\nimage processing, this which I got from Steve Gules, who\\'s another PhD student. It turns \\nout what you can do is if you give this sort of data, say an image, to certain unsupervised \\nlearning algorithms, they will then learn to group pixels together and say, gee, this sort of \\npixel seems to belong together, and that sort of pixel seems to belong together.  \\nAnd so the images you see on the bottom — I guess you can just barely see them on there \\n— so the images you see on the bottom are groupings — are what the algorithm has done \\nto group certain pixels together. On a small display, it might be easier to just look at the \\nimage on the right. The two images on the bottom are two sort of identical visualizations \\nof the same grouping of the pixels into [inaudible] regions.  \\nAnd so it turns out that this sort of clustering algorithm or this sort of unsupervised \\nlearning algorithm, which learns to group pixels together, it turns out to be useful for \\nmany applications in vision, in computer vision image processing.'),\n",

This is actually a \\npicture taken of the Stanford campus. You can apply that sort of clustering algorithm and \\ngroup the picture into regions. Let me actually blow that up so that you can see it more \\nclearly. Okay. So in the middle, you see the lines sort of grouping the image together, \\ngrouping the image into [inaudible] regions.  \\nAnd what Ashutosh and Min did was they then applied the learning algorithm to say can \\nwe take this clustering and use it to build a 3D model of the world? And so using the \\nclustering, they then had a learning algorithm try to learn what the 3D structure of the \\nworld looks like so that they could come up with a 3D model that you can sort of fly \\nthrough, okay? Although many people used to think it's not possible to take a single \\nimage and build a 3D model, but using a learning algorithm and that sort of clustering \\nalgorithm is the first step. They were able to.  \\nI'll just show you one more example. I like this because it's a picture of Stanford with our \\nbeautiful Stanford campus. So again, taking the same sort of clustering algorithms, taking \\nthe same sort of unsupervised learning algorithm, you can group the pixels into different \\nregions. And using that as a pre-processing step, they eventually built this sort of 3D \\nmodel of Stanford campus in a single picture. You can sort of walk into the ceiling, look \\naround the campus. Okay? This actually turned out to be a mix of supervised and \\nunsupervised learning, but the unsupervised learning, this sort of clustering was the first \\nstep.  \\nSo it turns out these sorts of unsupervised — clustering algorithms are actually routinely \\nused for many different problems, things like organizing computing clusters, social \\nnetwork analysis, market segmentation, so if you're a marketer and you want to divide \\nyour market into different segments or different groups of people to market to them \\nseparately; even for astronomical data analysis and understanding how galaxies are \\nformed. These are just a sort of small sample of the applications of unsupervised learning \\nalgorithms and clustering algorithms that we'll talk about later in this class.  \\nJust one particularly cool example of an unsupervised learning algorithm that I want to \\ntell you about. And to motivate that, I'm gonna tell you about what's called the cocktail \\nparty problem, which is imagine that you're at some cocktail party and there are lots of \\npeople standing all over. And you know how it is, right, if you're at a large party, \\neveryone's talking, it can be sometimes very hard to hear even the person in front of you. \\nSo imagine a large cocktail party with lots of people. So the problem is, is that all of these \\npeople talking, can you separate out the voice of just the person you're interested in \\ntalking to with all this loud background noise?  \\nSo I'll show you a specific example in a second, but here's a cocktail party that's I guess \\nrather sparsely attended by just two people. But what we're gonna do is we'll put two \\nmicrophones in the room, okay? And so because the microphones are just at slightly \\ndifferent distances to the two people, and the two people may speak in slightly different \\nvolumes, each microphone will pick up an overlapping combination of these two people's\"),\n",

So Speaker 1's voice may be more loud \\non Microphone 1, and Speaker 2's voice may be louder on Microphone 2, whatever.  \\nBut the question is, given these microphone recordings, can you separate out the original \\nspeaker's voices? So I'm gonna play some audio clips that were collected by Tai Yuan \\nLee at UCSD. I'm gonna actually play for you the original raw microphone recordings \\nfrom this cocktail party. So this is the Microphone 1:  \\nMicrophone 1:  \\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  \\nMicrophone 2:  \\nUno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis, siete, ocho, nueve, diez.  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : So it's a fascinating cocktail party with people counting from \\none to ten.

It sounds like a pretty complicated thing to do. So you\\'re gonna ask how complicated \\nis it really to implement an algorithm like this? It turns out if you do it in MATLAB, you \\ncan do it in one line of code.  \\nSo I got this from Samuel Wyse at Toronto, U of Toronto, and the example I showed you \\nactually used a more complicated ICA algorithm than this. But nonetheless, I guess this is \\nwhy for this class I\\'m going to ask you to do most of your programming in MATLAB and \\nOctave because if you try to implement the same algorithm in C or Java or something, I \\ncan tell you from personal, painful experience, you end up writing pages and pages of \\ncode rather than relatively few lines of code. I\\'ll also mention that it did take researchers \\nmany, many years to come up with that one line of code, so this is not easy.  \\nSo that was unsupervised learning, and then the last of the four major topics I wanna tell \\nyou about is reinforcement learning. And this refers to problems where you don\\'t do one-\\nshot decision-making. So, for example, in the supervised learning cancer prediction \\nproblem, you have a patient come in, you predict that the cancer is malignant or benign. \\nAnd then based on your prediction, maybe the patient lives or dies, and then that\\'s it, \\nright? So you make a decision and then there\\'s a consequence. You either got it right or \\nwrong. In reinforcement learning problems, you are usually asked to make a sequence of \\ndecisions over time.  \\nSo, for example, this is something that my students and I work on. If I give you the keys \\nto an autonomous helicopter — we actually ha ve this helicopter here at Stanford, — how \\ndo you write a program to make it fly, right? You notice that if you make a wrong \\ndecision on a helicopter, the consequence of crashing it may not happen until much later. \\nAnd in fact, usually you need to make a whole sequence of bad decisions to crash a \\nhelicopter. But conversely, you also need to make a whole sequence of good decisions in \\norder to fly a helicopter really well.  \\nSo I\\'m gonna show you some fun videos of learning algorithms flying helicopters. This is \\na video of our helicopter at Stanford flying using a controller that was learned using a \\nreinforcement learning algorithm. So this was done on the Stanford football field, and \\nwe\\'ll zoom out the camera in a second. You\\'ll sort of see the trees planted in the sky. So \\nmaybe this is one of the most difficult aerobatic maneuvers flown on any helicopter under \\ncomputer control. And this controller, which is very, very hard for a human to sit down \\nand write out, was learned using one of these reinforcement learning algorithms.  \\nJust a word about that: The basic idea behind a reinforcement learning algorithm is this \\nidea of what\\'s called a reward function. What we have to think about is imagine you\\'re \\ntrying to train a dog. So every time your dog does something good, you say, \"Good dog,\" \\nand you reward the dog. Every time your dog does something bad, you go, \"Bad dog,\" \\nright? And hopefully, over time, your dog will learn to do the right things to get more of \\nthe positive rewards, to get more of the \"Good dogs\" and to get fewer of the \"Bad dogs.”'),\n",

And \\nthen it\\'s up to the learning algorithm to figure out how to maximize the \"good dog\" \\nreward signals and minimize the \"bad dog\" punishments.  \\nSo it turns out reinforcement learning is applied to other problems in robotics. It\\'s applied \\nto things in web crawling and so on. But it\\'s just cool to show videos, so let me just show \\na bunch of them. This learning algorithm was actually implemented by our head TA, \\nZico, of programming a four-legged dog. I guess Sam Shriver in this class also worked \\non the project and Peter Renfrew and Mike and a few others. But I guess this really is a \\ngood dog/bad dog since it\\'s a robot dog.  \\nThe second video on the right, some of the students, I guess Peter, Zico, Tonca working \\non a robotic snake, again using learning algorithms to teach a snake robot to climb over \\nobstacles.  \\nBelow that, this is kind of a fun example. Ashutosh Saxena and Jeff Michaels used \\nlearning algorithms to teach a car how to drive at reasonably high speeds off roads \\navoiding obstacles.  \\nAnd on the lower right, that\\'s a robot programmed by PhD student Eva Roshen to teach a \\nsort of somewhat strangely configured robot how to get on top of an obstacle, how to get \\nover an obstacle. Sorry. I know the video\\'s kind of small. I hope you can sort of see it. \\nOkay?  \\nSo I think all of these are robots that I think are very difficult to hand-code a controller \\nfor by learning these sorts of learning algorithms. You can in relatively short order get a \\nrobot to do often pretty amazing things.  \\nOkay. So that was most of what I wanted to say today. Just a couple more last things, but \\nlet me just check what questions you have right now. So if there are no questions, I\\'ll just \\nclose with two reminders, which are after class today or as you start to talk with other \\npeople in this class, I just encourage you again to start to form project partners, to try to \\nfind project partners to do your project with. And also, this is a good time to start forming \\nstudy groups, so either talk to your friends or post in the newsgroup, but we just \\nencourage you to try to start to do both of those today, okay? Form study groups, and try \\nto find two other project partners.  \\nSo thank you. I\\'m looking forward to teaching this class, and I\\'ll see you in a couple of \\ndays.'),\n",

Remember at the last lecture, the \\ninitial lecture, I talked about supervised learning. And supervised learning was this \\nmachine-learning problem where I said we\\'re going to tell the algorithm what the close \\nright answer is for a number of examples, and then we want the algorithm to replicate \\nmore of the same.  \\nSo the example I had at the first lecture was the problem of predicting housing prices, \\nwhere you may have a training set, and we tell the algorithm what the \"right\" housing \\nprice was for every house in the training set. And then you want the algorithm to learn the \\nrelationship between sizes of houses and the prices, and essentially produce more of the \\n\"right\" answer.  \\nSo let me show you a video now. Load the big screen, please. So I\\'ll show you a video \\nnow that was from Dean Pomerleau at some work he did at Carnegie Mellon on applied \\nsupervised learning to get a car to drive itself. This is work on a vehicle known as Alvin. \\nIt was done sort of about 15 years ago, and I think it was a very elegant example of the \\nsorts of things you can get supervised or any algorithms to do.  \\nOn the video, you hear Dean Pomerleau\\'s voice mention and algorithm called Neural \\nNetwork. I\\'ll say a little bit about that later, but the essential learning algorithm for this is \\nsomething called gradient descent, which I will talk about later in today\\'s lecture. Let\\'s \\nwatch the video. [Video plays]  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):So two comments, right. One is this is supervised learning \\nbecause it\\'s learning from a human driver, in which a human driver shows that we\\'re on \\nthis segment of the road, I will steer at this angle. This segment of the road, I\\'ll steer at \\nthis angle. And so the human provides the number of \"correct\" steering directions to the \\ncar, and then it\\'s the job of the car to try to learn to produce more of these \"correct\" \\nsteering directions that keeps the car on the road.  \\nOn the monitor display up here, I just want to tell you a little bit about what this display \\nmeans. So on the upper left where the mouse pointer is moving, this horizontal line \\nactually shows the human steering direction, and this white bar, or this white area right \\nhere shows the steering direction chosen by the human driver, by moving the steering \\nwheel.  \\nThe human is steering a little bit to the left here indicated by the position of this white \\nregion. This second line here where Mamos is pointing, the second line here is the output \\nof the learning algorithm, and where the learning algorithm currently thinks is the right \\nsteering direction. And right now what you\\'re seeing is the learning algorithm just at the \\nvery beginning of training, and so there\\'s just no idea of where to steer. And so its output, \\nthis little white smear over the entire range of steering directions.  \\nAnd as the algorithm collects more examples and learns of a time, you see it start to more \\nconfidently choose a steering direction.

I should say, this work was done about 15 years \\nago and autonomous driving has come a long way. So many of you will have heard of the \\nDARPA Grand Challenge, where one of my colleagues, Sebastian Thrun, the winning \\nteam\\'s drive a car across a desert by itself.  \\nSo Alvin was, I think, absolutely amazing work for its time, but autonomous driving has \\nobviously come a long way since then. So what you just saw was an example, again, of \\nsupervised learning, and in particular it was an example of what they call the regression \\nproblem, because the vehicle is trying to predict a continuous value variables of a \\ncontinuous value steering directions, we call the regression problem.  \\nAnd what I want to do today is talk about our first supervised learning algorithm, and it \\nwill also be to a regression task. So for the running example that I\\'m going to use \\nthroughout today\\'s lecture, you\\'re going to return to the example of trying to predict \\nhousing prices. So here\\'s actually a dataset collected by TA, Dan Ramage, on housing \\nprices in Portland, Oregon.  \\nSo here\\'s a dataset of a number of houses of different sizes, and here are their asking \\nprices in thousands of dollars, $200,000. And so we can take this data and plot it, square \\nfeet, best price, and so you make your other dataset like that. And the question is, given a \\ndataset like this, or given what we call a training set like this, how do you learn to predict \\nthe relationship between the size of the house and the price of the house?  \\nSo I\\'m actually going to come back and modify this task a little bit more later, but let me \\ngo ahead and introduce some notation, which I\\'ll be using, actually, throughout the rest of \\nthis course. The first piece of notation is I\\'m going to let the lower case alphabet M \\ndenote the number of training examples, and that just means the number of rows, or the \\nnumber of examples, houses, and prices we have.  \\nAnd in this particular dataset, we have, what actually happens, we have 47 training \\nexamples, although I wrote down only five. Okay, so throughout this quarter, I\\'m going \\nto use the alphabet M to denote the number of training examples. I\\'m going to use the \\nlower case alphabet X to denote the input variables, which I\\'ll often also call the features. \\nAnd so in this case, X would denote the size of the house they were looking at.  \\nI\\'m going to use Y to denote the \"output\" variable, which is sometimes also called a \\ntarget variable, and so one pair, x, y, is what comprises one training example. In other \\nwords, one row on the table I drew just now what would be what I call one training \\nexample, and the Ith training example, in other words the Ith row in that table, I\\'m going \\nto write as XI, Y, I.  \\nOkay, and so in this notation they\\'re going to use this superscript I is not exponentiation. \\nSo this is not X to the power of IY to the power of I. In this notation, the superscript I in \\nparentheses is just sort of an index into the Ith row of my list of training examples.'),\n",

We're given a training set, and \\nwe're going to feed our training set, comprising our M training example, so 47 training \\nexamples, into a learning algorithm. Okay, and our algorithm then has output function \\nthat is by tradition, and for historical reasons, is usually denoted lower case alphabet H, \\nand is called a hypothesis. Don't worry too much about whether the term hypothesis has a \\ndeep meaning. It's more a term that's used for historical reasons.  \\nAnd the hypothesis's job is to take this input. There's some new [inaudible]. What the \\nhypothesis does is it takes this input, a new living area in square feet saying and output \\nestimates the price of this house. So the hypothesis H maps from inputs X to outputs Y. \\nSo in order to design a learning algorithm, the first thing we have to decide is how we \\nwant to represent the hypothesis, right.  \\nAnd just for this purposes of this lecture, for the purposes of our first learning algorithm, \\nI'm going to use a linear representation for the hypothesis. So I'm going to represent my \\nhypothesis as H of X equals theta zero, plus theta 1X, where X here is an input feature, \\nand so that's the size of the house we're considering.  \\nAnd more generally, come back to this, more generally for many regression problems we \\nmay have more than one input feature. So for example, if instead of just knowing the size \\nof the houses, if we know also the number of bedrooms in these houses, let's say, then, so \\nif our training set also has a second feature, the number of bedrooms in the house, then \\nyou may, let's say X1 denote the size and square feet. Let X have script two denote the \\nnumber of bedrooms, and then I would write the hypothesis, H of X, as theta rho plus \\ntheta 1X1 plus theta 2X2.  \\nOkay, and sometimes when I went to take the hypothesis H, and when I went to make \\nthis dependent on the theta is explicit, I'll sometimes write this as H subscript theta of X. \\nAnd so this is the price that my hypothesis predicts a house with features X costs. So \\ngiven the new house with features X, a certain size and a certain number of bedrooms, \\nthis is going to be the price that my hypothesis predicts this house is going to cost.  \\nOne final piece of notation, so for conciseness, just to write this a bit more compactly I'm \\ngoing to take the convention of defining X0 to be equal to one, and so I can now write H \\nof X to be equal to sum from I equals one to two of theta I, oh sorry, zero to two, theta I, \\nX I. And if you think of theta as an X, as vectors, then this is just theta transpose X.  \\nAnd the very final piece of notation is I'm also going to let lower case N be the number of \\nfeatures in my learning problem. And so this actually becomes a sum from I equals zero \\nto N, where in this example if you have two features, N would be equal to two.  \\nAll right, I realize that was a fair amount of notation, and as I proceed through the rest of \\nthe lecture today, or in future weeks as well, if some day you're looking at me write a \\nsymbol and you're wondering, gee, what was that simple lower case N again? Or what \\nwas that lower case X again, or whatever, please raise hand and I'll answer. This is a fair\"),\n",

A little bit actually later this quarter, we'll talk about much more \\ncomplicated hypothesis classes, and we'll actually talk about higher order functions as \\nwell, a little bit later today.  \\nOkay, so for the learning problem then.

And so going to fill this \\nin. We have M training examples. So the sum from I equals one through M of my M \\ntraining examples, of price predicted on the Ith house in my training set. Mine is the \\nactual target variable. Mine is actual price on the Ith training example.  \\nAnd by convention, instead of minimizing this sum of the squared differences, I'm just \\ngoing to put a one-half there, which will simplify some of the math we do later. Okay, \\nand so let me go ahead and define J of theta to be equal to just the same, one-half sum \\nfrom I equals one through M on the number of training examples, of the value predicted \\nby my hypothesis minus the actual value.  \\nAnd so what we'll do, let's say, is minimize as a function of the parameters of theta, this \\nquantity J of theta. I should say, to those of you who have taken sort of linear algebra \\nclasses, or maybe basic statistics classes, some of you may have seen things like these \\nbefore and seen least [inaudible] regression or [inaudible] squares.  \\nMany of you will not have seen this before. I think some of you may have seen it before, \\nbut either way, regardless of whether you've seen it before, let's keep going. Just for those \\nof you that have seen it before, I should say eventually, we'll actually show that this \\nalgorithm is a special case of a much broader class of algorithms. But let's keep going. \\nWe'll get there eventually.  \\nSo I'm going to talk about a couple of different algorithms for performing that \\nminimization over theta of J of theta. The first algorithm I'm going to talk about is a \\nsearch algorithm, where the basic idea is we'll start with some value of my parameter \\nvector theta. Maybe initialize my parameter vector theta to be the vector of all zeros, and \\nexcuse me, have to correct that. I sort of write zero with an arrow on top to denote the \\nvector of all zeros.  \\nAnd then I'm going to keep changing my parameter vector theta to reduce J of theta a \\nlittle bit, until we hopefully end up at the minimum with respect to theta of J of theta. So \\nswitch the laptops please, and lower the big screen. So let me go ahead and show you an \\nanimation of this first algorithm for minimizing J of theta, which is an algorithm called \\ngrading and descent.  \\nSo here's the idea. You see on the display a plot and the axes, the horizontal axes are \\ntheta zero and theta one. That's usually – minimize J of theta, which is represented by the \\nheight of this plot. So the surface represents the function J of theta and the axes of this \\nfunction, or the inputs of this function are the parameters theta zero and theta one, written \\ndown here below.\"),\n",

I\\'m going to choose some initial point. It could \\nbe vector of all zeros or some randomly chosen point. Let\\'s say we start from that point \\ndenoted by the star, by the cross, and now I want you to imagine that this display actually \\nshows a 3D landscape. Imagine you\\'re all in a hilly park or something, and this is the 3D \\nshape of, like, a hill in some park.  \\nSo imagine you\\'re actually standing physically at the position of that star, of that cross, \\nand imagine you can stand on that hill, right, and look all 360 degrees around you and \\nask, if I were to take a small step, what would allow me to go downhill the most? Okay, \\njust imagine that this is physically a hill and you\\'re standing there, and would look around \\nask, \"If I take a small step, what is the direction of steepest descent, that would take me \\ndownhill as quickly as possible?\"  \\nSo the gradient descent algorithm does exactly that. I\\'m going to take a small step in this \\ndirection of steepest descent, or the direction that the gradient turns out to be. And then \\nyou take a small step and you end up at a new point shown there, and it would keep \\ngoing. You\\'re now at a new point on this hill, and again you\\'re going to look around you, \\nlook all 360 degrees around you, and ask, \"What is the direction that would take me \\ndownhill as quickly as possible?\"  \\nAnd we want to go downhill as quickly as possible, because we want to find the \\nminimum of J of theta. So you do that again. You can take another step, okay, and you \\nsort of keep going until you end up at a local minimum of this function, J of theta. One \\nproperty of gradient descent is that where you end up – in this case, we ended up at this \\npoint on the lower left hand corner of this plot.  \\nBut let\\'s try running gradient descent again from a different position. So that was where I \\nstarted gradient descent just now. Let\\'s rerun gradient descent, but using a slightly \\ndifferent initial starting point, so a point slightly further up and further to the right. So it \\nturns out if you run gradient descent from that point, then if you take a steepest descent \\ndirection again, that\\'s your first step.  \\nAnd if you keep going, it turns out that with a slightly different initial starting point, you \\ncan actually end up at a completely different local optimum. Okay, so this is a property of \\ngradient descent, and we\\'ll come back to it in a second. So be aware that gradient descent \\ncan sometimes depend on where you initialize your parameters, theta zero and theta one.  \\nSwitch back to the chalkboard, please. Let\\'s go ahead and work out the math of the \\ngradient descent algorithm. Then we\\'ll come back and revisit this issue of local optimum. \\nSo here\\'s the gradient descent algorithm.  \\nWe\\'re going to take a repeatedly take a step in the direction of steepest descent, and it \\nturns out that you can write that as [inaudible], which is we\\'re going to update the \\nparameters theta as theta I minus the partial derivative with respect to theta I, J of Theta. \\nOkay, so this is how we\\'re going to update the I parameter, theta I, how we\\'re going to \\nupdate Theta I on each iteration of gradient descent.'),\n",

I'm claiming that the \\nvalue of A is equal to the value of B, whereas this is computer operation where we \\noverwrite the value of A. If I write A equals B then I'm asserting that the values of A and \\nB are equal.  \\nSo let's see, this algorithm sort of makes sense – well, actually let's just move on. Let's \\njust go ahead and take this algorithm and apply it to our problem. And to work out \\ngradient descent, let's take gradient descent and just apply it to our problem, and this \\nbeing the first somewhat mathematical lecture, I'm going to step through derivations \\nmuch more slowly and carefully than I will later in this quarter. We'll work through the \\nsteps of these in much more detail than I will later in this quarter.  \\nLet's actually work out what this gradient descent rule is. So – and I'll do this just for the \\ncase of, if we had only one training example. Okay, so in this case we need to work out \\nwhat the partial derivative with respect to the parameter theta I of J of theta. If we have \\nonly one training example then J of theta is going to be one-half of script theta, of X \\nminus Y, script. So if you have only one training example comprising one pair, X, Y, \\nthen this is what J of theta is going to be.  \\nAnd so taking derivatives, you have one-half something squared. So the two comes \\ndown. So you have two times one-half times theta of X minus Y, and then by the \\n[inaudible] derivatives, we also must apply this by the derivative of what's inside the \\nsquare. Right, the two and the one-half cancel. So this leaves [inaudible] times that, theta \\nzero, X zero plus [inaudible].  \\nOkay, and if you look inside this sum, we're taking the partial derivative of this sum with \\nrespect to the parameter theta I. But all the terms in the sum, except for one, do not \\ndepend on theta I. In this sum, the only term that depends on theta I will be some term \\nhere of theta I, X I. And so we take the partial derivative with respect to theta I, X I – take \\nthe partial derivative with respect to theta I of this term theta I, X I, and so you get that \\ntimes X I.  \\nOkay, and so this gives us our learning rule, right, of theta I gets updated as theta I minus \\nalpha times that. Okay, and this Greek alphabet alpha here is a parameter of the algorithm \\ncalled the learning rate, and this parameter alpha controls how large a step you take. So \\nyou're standing on the hill. You decided what direction to take a step in, and so this \\nparameter alpha controls how aggressive – how large a step you take in this direction of \\nsteepest descent.\"),\n",

If alpha is too large then the steepest descent may \\nactually end up overshooting the minimum, if you're taking too aggressive a step.  \\nYeah?  \\nStudent:[Inaudible].  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Say that again?  \\nStudent:Isn't there a one over two missing somewhere?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Is there a one-half missing?  \\nStudent:I was [inaudible].  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Thanks. I do make lots of errors in that. Any questions about \\nthis?  \\nAll right, so let me just wrap this property into an algorithm. So over there I derived the \\nalgorithm where you have just one training example, more generally for M training \\nexamples, gradient descent becomes the following. We're going to repeat until \\nconvergence the following step.  \\nOkay, theta I gets updated as theta I and I'm just writing out the appropriate equation for \\nM examples rather than one example. Theta I gets updated. Theta I minus alpha times the \\nsum from I equals one to M. Okay, and I won't bother to show it, but you can go home \\nand sort of verify for yourself that this summation here, this is indeed the partial \\nderivative with respect to theta I of J of theta, where if you use the original definition of J \\nof theta for when you have M training examples.  \\nOkay, so I'm just going to show – switch back to the laptop display. I'm going to show \\nyou what this looks like when you run the algorithm. So it turns out that for the specific \\nproblem of linear regression, or ordinary release squares, which is what we're doing \\ntoday, the function J of theta actually does not look like this nasty one that I'll show you \\njust now with a multiple local optima.  \\nIn particular, it turns out for ordinary release squares, the function J of theta is – it's just a \\nquadratic function. And so we'll always have a nice bow shape, like what you see up \\nhere, and only have one global minimum with no other local optima.  \\nSo when you run gradient descent, here are actually the contours of the function J.

The \\nfunction, J of theta has no local optima. Yes, question?  \\nStudent:Is the alpha changing every time?

And the reason is, the update is – you update theta by subtracting from alpha \\ntimes the gradient. And so as you approach the local minimum, the gradient also goes to \\nzero.  \\nAs you approach the local minimum, at the local minimum the gradient is zero, and as \\nyou approach the local minimum, the gradient also gets smaller and smaller. And so \\ngradient descent will automatically take smaller and smaller steps as you approach the \\nlocal minimum. Make sense?  \\nAnd here's the same plot – here's actually a plot of the housing prices data. So here, lets \\nyou initialize the parameters to the vector of all zeros, and so this blue line at the bottom \\nshows the hypothesis with the parameters of initialization.

So it \\nactually turns out – I'm not sure I'll answer the second part, but it turns out that if you \\nstand on the hill and if you – it turns out that when you compute the gradient of the \\nfunction, when you compute the derivative of the function, then it just turns out that that \\nis indeed the direction of steepest descent.  \\nBy the way, I just want to point out, you would never want to go in the opposite direction \\nbecause the opposite direction would actually be the direction of steepest ascent, right. So \\nas it turns out – maybe the TAs can talk a bit more about this at the section if there's \\ninterest. It turns out, when you take the derivative of a function, the derivative of a \\nfunction sort of turns out to just give you the direction of steepest descent.  \\nAnd so you don't explicitly look all 360 degrees around you.

You're going to perform a sum over your M \\ntraining examples.  \\nSo [inaudible] descent often works very well. I use it very often, and it turns out that \\nsometimes if you have a really, really large training set, imagine that instead of having 47 \\nhouses from Portland, Oregon in our training set, if you had, say, the U.S. Census \\nDatabase or something, with U.S. census size databases you often have hundreds of \\nthousands or millions of training examples.  \\nSo if M is a few million then if you're running batch rate and descent, this means that to \\nperform every step of gradient descent you need to perform a sum from J equals one to a\"),\n",

That's sort of a lot of training examples where your computer programs have to \\nlook at, before you can even take one step downhill on the function J of theta.  \\nSo it turns out that when you have very large training sets, you should write down an \\nalternative algorithm that is called [inaudible] gradient descent. Sometimes I'll also call it \\nincremental gradient descent, but the algorithm is as follows. Again, it will repeat until \\nconvergence and will iterate for J equals one to M, and will perform one of these sort of \\ngradient descent updates using just the J training example.  \\nOh, and as usual, this is really – you update all the parameters data runs. You perform \\nthis update for all values of I. For I indexes and the parameter vectors, you just perform \\nthis update, all of your parameters simultaneously. And the advantage of this algorithm is \\nthat in order to start learning, in order to start modifying the parameters, you only need to \\nlook at your first training examples.  \\nYou should look at your first training example and perform an update using the derivative \\nof the error with respect to just your first training example, and then you look at your \\nsecond training example and perform another update. And you sort of keep adapting your \\nparameters much more quickly without needing to scan over your entire U.S. Census \\ndatabase before you can even start adapting parameters.  \\nSo let's see, for launch data sets, so constantly gradient descent is often much faster, and \\nwhat happens is that constant gradient descent is that it won't actually converge to the \\nglobal minimum exactly, but if these are the contours of your function, then after you run \\nthe constant gradient descent, you sort of tend to wander around.  \\nAnd you may actually end up going uphill occasionally, but your parameters will sort of \\ntender to wander to the region closest to the global minimum, but sort of keep wandering \\naround a little bit near the region of the global [inaudible]. And often that's just fine to \\nhave a parameter that wanders around a little bit the global minimum. And in practice, \\nthis often works much faster than back gradient descent, especially if you have a large \\ntraining set.  \\nOkay, I'm going to clean a couple of boards. While I do that, why don't you take a look at \\nthe equations, and after I'm done cleaning the boards, I'll ask what questions you have.  \\nOkay, so what questions do you have about all of this?  \\nStudent:[Inaudible] is it true – are you just sort of rearranging the order that you do the \\ncomputation? So do you just use the first training example and update all of the theta Is \\nand then step, and then update with the second training example, and update all the theta \\nIs, and then step? And is that why you get sort of this really – ?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Let's see, right. So I'm going to look at my first training \\nexample and then I'm going to take a step, and then I'm going to perform the second\"),\n",

I believe this theory that \\nsort of supports that as well. Yeah, the theory that supports that, the [inaudible] of \\ntheorem is, I don't remember.  \\nOkay, cool.

It \\nturns out there's another way to perform this minimization of J of theta that allows you to \\nsolve for the parameters theta in close form, without needing to run an iterative \\nalgorithm.  \\nAnd I know some of you may have seen some of what I'm about to do before, in like an \\nundergraduate linear algebra course, and the way it's typically done requires [inaudible] \\nprojections, or taking lots of derivatives and writing lots of algebra. What I'd like to do is \\nshow you a way to derive the closed form solution of theta in just a few lines of algebra.  \\nBut to do that, I'll need to introduce a new notation for matrix derivatives, and it turns out \\nthat, sort of, the notation I'm about to define here just in my own personal work has \\nturned out to be one of the most useful things that I actually use all the time, to have a \\nnotation of how to take derivatives with respect to matrixes, so that you can solve for the \\nminimum of J of theta with, like, a few lines of algebra rather than writing out pages and \\npages of matrices and derivatives.  \\nSo then we're going to define this new notation first and then we'll go ahead and work out \\nthe minimization. Given a function J, since J is a function of a vector of parameters theta, \\nright, I'm going to define the derivative of the gradient of J with respect to theta, as self of \\nvector. Okay, and so this is going to be an N plus one dimensional vector. Theta is an n \\nplus one dimensional vector with indices ranging from zero to N. And so I'm going to \\ndefine this derivative to be equal to that.  \\nOkay, and so we can actually rewrite the gradient descent algorithm as follows.

I was using the boards out of order, wasn't I? So \\nmore generally, if you have a function F that maps from the space of matrices A, that \\nmaps from, say, the space of N by N matrices to the space of real numbers. So if you \\nhave a function, F of A, where A is an N by N matrix.  \\nSo this function is matched from matrices to real numbers, the function that takes this \\ninput to matrix. Let me define the derivative with respect to F of the matrix A. Now, I'm \\njust taking the gradient of F with respect to its input, which is the matrix. I'm going to \\ndefine this itself to be a matrix.  \\nOkay, so the derivative of F with respect to A is itself a matrix, and the matrix contains \\nall the partial derivatives of F with respect to the elements of A. One more definition is if \\nA is a square matrix, so if A is an n by n matrix, number of rows equals number of \\ncolumns, let me define the trace of A to be equal to the sum of A's diagonal elements. So \\nthis is just sum over I of A, I, I.  \\nFor those of you that haven't seen this sort of operator notation before, you can think of \\ntrace of A as the trace operator applied to the square matrix A, but it's more commonly \\nwritten without the parentheses. So I usually write trace of A like this, and this just means \\nthe sum of diagonal elements.  \\nSo here are some facts about the trace operator and about derivatives, and I'm just going \\nto write these without proof. You can also have the TAs prove some of them in the \\ndiscussion section, or you can actually go home and verify the proofs of all of these.  \\nIt turns out that given two matrices, A and B, the trace of the matrix A times B is equal to \\nthe trace of B, A. Okay, I'm not going to prove this, but you should be able to go home \\nand prove this yourself without too much difficulty. And similarly, the trace of a product \\nof three matrices, so if you can take the matrix at the end and cyclically permeate it to the \\nfront.  \\nSo trace of A times B, times C, is equal to the trace of C, A, B. So take the matrix C at \\nthe back and move it to the front, and this is also equal to the trace of B, C. Take the \\nmatrix B and move it to the front.  \\nOkay, also, suppose you have a function F of A which is defined as a trace of A, B. Okay, \\nso this is, right, the trace is a real number. So the trace of A, B is a function that takes this \\ninput of matrix A and output a real number. So then the derivative with respect to the \\nmatrix A of this function of trace A, B, is going to be B transposed. And this is just \\nanother fact that you can prove by yourself by going back and referring to the definitions \\nof traces and matrix derivatives. I'm not going to prove it.

So the trace of a one by one matrix is just whatever that real number is.  \\nAnd lastly, this is a somewhat tricky one. The derivative with respect to the matrix A of \\nthe trace of A, B, A, transpose C is equal to C, A, B plus C transposed A, B transposed. \\nAnd I won't prove that either. This is sort of just algebra. Work it out yourself.  \\nOkay, and so the key facts I'm going to use again about traces and matrix derivatives, I'll \\nuse five. Ten minutes. Okay, so armed with these things I'm going to figure out – let's try \\nto come up with a quick derivation for how to minimize J of theta as a function of theta in \\nclosed form, and without needing to use an iterative algorithm.  \\nSo work this out. Let me define the matrix X. This is called the design matrix. To be a \\nmatrix containing all the inputs from my training set. So X 1 was the vector of inputs to \\nthe vector of features for my first training example. So I'm going to set X 1 to be the first \\nrow of this matrix X, set my second training example is in place to be the second \\nvariable, and so on.  \\nAnd I have M training examples, and so that's going to be my design matrix X. Okay, this \\nis defined as matrix capital X as follows, and so now, let me take this matrix X and \\nmultiply it by my parameter vector theta. This derivation will just take two or three sets. \\nSo X times theta – remember how matrix vector multiplication goes. You take this vector \\nand you multiply it by each of the rows of the matrix.  \\nSo X times theta is just going to be X 1 transposed theta, dot, dot, dot, down to X M, \\ntransposed theta. And this is, of course, just the predictions of your hypothesis on each of \\nyour M training examples. Then we also defined the Y vector to be the vector of all the \\ntarget values Y1 through YM in my training set. Okay, so Y vector is an M dimensional \\nvector.  \\nSo X theta minus Y contained the math from the previous board, this is going to be, right, \\nand now, X theta minus Y, this is a vector. This is an M dimensional vector in M training \\nexamples, and so I'm actually going to take this vector and take this inner product with \\nitself.  \\nOkay, so we call that if Z is a vector than Z transpose Z is just sum over I, ZI squared. \\nRight, that's how you take the inner product of a vector with a sum. So you want to take \\nthis vector, X theta minus Y, and take the inner product of this vector with itself, and so \\nthat gives me sum from I equals one to M, H, F, X, I, minus Y squared. Okay, since it's \\njust the sum of the squares of the elements of this vector.  \\nAnd put a half there for the emphasis. This is our previous definition of J of theta. Okay, \\nyeah?\"),\n",

Does that make sense?  \\nSo this is the sum from one through M. It's sort of theta transpose X that's equal to sum \\nfrom J equals zero through N of theta J, X, J. Does that make sense? It's the feature \\nvectors that index from zero through N where X, zero is equal to one, whereas the \\ntraining example is actually indexed from one through M.  \\nSo let me clean a few more boards and take another look at this, make sure it all makes \\nsense.

Great, I training example. Anything else? Cool. So we're actually nearly done with \\nthis derivation. We would like to minimize J of theta with respect to theta and we've \\nwritten J of theta fairly compactly using this matrix vector notation.  \\nSo in order to minimize J of theta with respect to theta, what we're going to do is take the \\nderivative with respect to theta of J of theta, and set this to zero, and solve for theta. \\nOkay, so we have derivative with respect to theta of that is equal to – I should mention \\nthere will be some steps here that I'm just going to do fairly quickly without proof.  \\nSo is it really true that the derivative of half of that is half of the derivative, and I already \\nexchanged the derivative and the one-half.

Actually, this thing here is also a real number and the transpose of a real \\nnumber is just itself.

A real number transposed itself is \\njust the same real number. So this is minus the trace of, taking the transpose of that. \\nHere's Y transpose X theta, then minus [inaudible] theta.

So just drop that term.  \\nAnd lastly, well, the derivative with respect to theta of the trace of theta, theta transposed, \\nX transpose X. I'm going to use one of the facts I wrote down earlier without proof, and \\nI'm going to let this be A. There's an identity matrix there, so this is A, B, A transpose C, \\nand using a rule that I've written down previously that you'll find in lecture notes, because \\nit's still on one of the boards that you had previously, this is just equal to X transpose X \\ntheta.  \\nSo this is C, A, B, which is sort of just the identity matrix, which you can ignore, plus X \\ntranspose X theta where this is now C transpose C, again times the identity which we're \\ngoing to ignore, times B transposed.

Good morning and welcome back to the third lecture of \\nthis class. So here’s what I want to do today, and some of the topics I do today may seem \\na little bit like I’m jumping, sort of, from topic to topic, but here’s, sort of, the outline for \\ntoday and the illogical flow of ideas. In the last lecture, we talked about linear regression \\nand today I want to talk about sort of an adaptation of that called locally weighted \\nregression. It’s very a popular algorithm that’s actually one of my former mentors \\nprobably favorite machine learning algorithm.  \\nWe’ll then talk about a probable second interpretation of linear regression and use that to \\nmove onto our first classification algorithm, which is logistic regression; take a brief \\ndigression to tell you about something called the perceptron algorithm, which is \\nsomething we’ll come back to, again, later this quarter; and time allowing I hope to get to \\nNewton’s method, which is an algorithm for fitting logistic regression models.  \\nSo this is recap where we’re talking about in the previous lecture, remember the notation \\nI defined was that I used this X superscript I, Y superscript I to denote the I training \\nexample. And when we’re talking about linear regression or linear least squares, we use \\nthis to denote the predicted value of “by my hypothesis H” on the input XI. And my \\nhypothesis was franchised by the vector of grams as theta and so we said that this was \\nequal to some from theta J, si J, and more theta transpose X. And we had the convention \\nthat X subscript Z is equal to one so this accounts for the intercept term in our linear \\nregression model. And lowercase n here was the notation I was using for the number of \\nfeatures in my training set. Okay? So in the example when trying to predict housing \\nprices, we had two features, the size of the house and the number of bedrooms. We had \\ntwo features and there was – little n was equal to two. So just to finish recapping the \\nprevious lecture, we defined this quadratic cos function J of theta equals one-half, \\nsomething I equals one to m, theta of XI minus YI squared where this is the sum over our \\nm training examples and my training set. So lowercase m was the notation I’ve been \\nusing to denote the number of training examples I have and the size of my training set. \\nAnd at the end of the last lecture, we derive the value of theta that minimizes this \\nenclosed form, which was X transpose X inverse X transpose Y. Okay?  \\nSo as we move on in today’s lecture, I’ll continue to use this notation and, again, I realize \\nthis is a fair amount of notation to all remember, so if partway through this lecture you \\nforgot – if you’re having trouble remembering what lowercase m is or what lowercase n \\nis or something please raise your hand and ask. When we talked about linear regression \\nlast time we used two features. One of the features was the size of the houses in square \\nfeet, so the living area of the house, and the other feature was the number of bedrooms in \\nthe house. In general, we apply a machine-learning algorithm to some problem that you \\ncare about. The choice of the features will very much be up to you, right? And the way \\nyou choose your features to give the learning algorithm will often have a large impact on \\nhow it actually does. So just for example, the choice we made last time was X1 equal this \\nsize, and let’s leave this idea of the feature of the number of bedrooms for now, let’s say \\nwe don’t have data that tells us how many bedrooms are in these houses.

And so, right? So say that was the \\nsize of the house and that’s the price of the house. So if you use this as a feature maybe \\nyou get theta zero plus theta 1, X1, this, sort of, linear model. If you choose – let me just \\ncopy the same data set over, right? You can define the set of features where X1 is equal \\nto the size of the house and X2 is the square of the size of the house. Okay? So X1 is the \\nsize of the house in say square footage and X2 is just take whatever the square footage of \\nthe house is and just square that number, and this would be another way to come up with \\na feature, and if you do that then the same algorithm will end up fitting a quadratic \\nfunction for you. Theta 2, XM squared. Okay? Because this is actually X2. And \\ndepending on what the data looks like, maybe this is a slightly better fit to the data.  \\nYou can actually take this even further, right? Which is – let’s see. I have seven training \\nexamples here, so you can actually maybe fit up to six for the polynomial. You can \\nactually fill a model theta zero plus theta one, X1 plus theta two, X squared plus up to \\ntheta six. X to the power of six and theta six are the polynomial to these seven data \\npoints. And if you do that you find that you come up with a model that fits your data \\nexactly. This is where, I guess, in this example I drew, we have seven data points, so if \\nyou fit a six model polynomial you can, sort of, fit a line that passes through these seven \\npoints perfectly. And you probably find that the curve you get will look something like \\nthat. And on the one hand, this is a great model in a sense that it fits your training data \\nperfectly. On the other hand, this is probably not a very good model in the sense that \\nnone of us seriously think that this is a very good predictor of housing prices as a \\nfunction of the size of the house, right?  \\nSo we’ll actually come back to this later. It turns out of the models we have here; I feel \\nlike maybe the quadratic model fits the data best. Whereas the linear model looks like \\nthere’s actually a bit of a quadratic component in this data that the linear function is not \\ncapturing. So we’ll actually come back to this a little bit later and talk about the problems \\nassociated with fitting models that are either too simple, use two small a set of features, \\nor on the models that are too complex and maybe use too large a set of features. Just to \\ngive these a name, we call this the problem of underfitting and, very informally, this \\nrefers to a setting where there are obvious patterns that – where there are patterns in the \\ndata that the algorithm is just failing to fit. And this problem here we refer to as \\noverfitting and, again, very informally, this is when the algorithm is fitting the \\nidiosyncrasies of this specific data set, right? It just so happens that of the seven houses \\nwe sampled in Portland, or wherever you collect data from, that house happens to be a bit \\nmore expensive, that house happened on the less expensive, and by fitting six for the \\npolynomial we’re, sort of, fitting the idiosyncratic properties of this data set, rather than \\nthe true underlying trends of how housing prices vary as the function of the size of house. \\nOkay?  \\nSo these are two very different problems. We’ll define them more formally me later and \\ntalk about how to address each of these problems, but for now I hope you appreciate that \\nthere is this issue of selecting features. So if you want to just teach us the learning \\nproblems there are a few ways to do so. We’ll talk about feature selection algorithms later \\nthis quarter as well. So automatic algorithms for choosing what features you use in a'),\n",

What I want to do today is talk about a class of algorithms \\ncalled non-parametric learning algorithms that will help to alleviate the need somewhat \\nfor you to choose features very carefully. Okay? And this leads us into our discussion of \\nlocally weighted regression. And just to define the term, linear regression, as we’ve \\ndefined it so far, is an example of a parametric learning algorithm. Parametric learning \\nalgorithm is one that’s defined as an algorithm that has a fixed number of parameters that \\nfit to the data. Okay? So in linear regression we have a fix set of parameters theta, right? \\nThat must fit to the data. In contrast, what I’m gonna talk about now is our first non-\\nparametric learning algorithm. The formal definition, which is not very intuitive, so I’ve \\nreplaced it with a second, say, more intuitive. The, sort of, formal definition of the non-\\nparametric learning algorithm is that it’s an algorithm where the number of parameters \\ngoes with M, with the size of the training set. And usually it’s defined as a number of \\nparameters grows linearly with the size of the training set. This is the formal definition. A \\nslightly less formal definition is that the amount of stuff that your learning algorithm \\nneeds to keep around will grow linearly with the training sets or, in another way of saying \\nit, is that this is an algorithm that we’ll need to keep around an entire training set, even \\nafter learning. Okay? So don’t worry too much about this definition. But what I want to \\ndo now is describe a specific non-parametric learning algorithm called locally weighted \\nregression. Which also goes by a couple of other names – which also goes by the name of \\nLoess for self-hysterical reasons. Loess is usually spelled L-O-E-S-S, sometimes spelled \\nlike that, too. I just call it locally weighted regression. So here’s the idea. This will be an \\nalgorithm that allows us to worry a little bit less about having to choose features very \\ncarefully. So for my motivating example, let’s say that I have a training site that looks \\nlike this, okay? So this is X and that’s Y. If you run linear regression on this and you fit \\nmaybe a linear function to this and you end up with a more or less flat, straight line, \\nwhich is not a very good fit to this data. You can sit around and stare at this and try to \\ndecide whether the features are used right. So maybe you want to toss in a quadratic \\nfunction, but this isn’t really quadratic either. So maybe you want to model this as a X \\nplus X squared plus maybe some function of sin of X or something. You actually sit \\naround and fiddle with features. And after a while you can probably come up with a set of \\nfeatures that the model is okay, but let’s talk about an algorithm that you can use without \\nneeding to do that.  \\nSo if – well, suppose you want to evaluate your hypothesis H at a certain point with a \\ncertain query point low K is X. Okay? And let’s say you want to know what’s the \\npredicted value of Y at this position of X, right? So for linear regression, what we were \\ndoing was we would fit theta to minimize sum over I, YI minus theta, transpose XI \\nsquared, and return theta transpose X. Okay? So that was linear regression. In contrast, in \\nlocally weighted linear regression you’re going to do things slightly different. You’re \\ngoing to look at this point X and then I’m going to look in my data set and take into \\naccount only the data points that are, sort of, in the little vicinity of X. Okay? So we’ll \\nlook at where I want to value my hypothesis. I’m going to look only in the vicinity of this \\npoint where I want to value my hypothesis, and then I’m going to take, let’s say, just \\nthese few points, and I will apply linear regression to fit a straight line just to this sub-set \\nof the data. Okay? I’m using this sub-term sub-set – well let’s come back to that later. So \\nwe take this data set and I fit a straight line to it and maybe I get a straight line like that.'),\n",

I think this would be the predicted value for – this would \\nbe the value of then my hypothesis outputs in locally weighted regression. Okay?  \\nSo we’re gonna fall one up. Let me go ahead and formalize that. In locally weighted \\nregression, we’re going to fit theta to minimize sum over I to minimize that where these \\nterms W superscript I are called weights. There are many possible choice for ways, I’m \\njust gonna write one down. So this E’s and minus, XI minus X squared over two. So let’s \\nlook at what these weights really are, right? So notice that – suppose you have a training \\nexample XI. So that XI is very close to X. So this is small, right? Then if XI minus X is \\nsmall, so if XI minus X is close to zero, then this is E’s to the minus zero and E to the \\nzero is one. So if XI is close to X, then WI will be close to one. In other words, the \\nweight associated with the, I training example be close to one if XI and X are close to \\neach other. Conversely if XI minus X is large then – I don’t know, what would WI be?  \\nStudent:Zero.  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Zero, right. Close to zero. Right. So if XI is very far from X \\nthen this is E to the minus of some large number and E to the minus some large number \\nwill be close to zero. Okay? So the picture is, if I’m quarrying at a certain point X, shown \\non the X axis, and if my data set, say, look like that, then I’m going to give the points \\nclose to this a large weight and give the points far away a small weight. So for the points \\nthat are far away, WI will be close to zero. And so as if for the points that are far away, \\nthey will not contribute much at all to this summation, right? So I think this is sum over I \\nof one times this quadratic term for points by points plus zero times this quadratic term \\nfor faraway points. And so the effect of using this weighting is that locally weighted \\nlinear regression fits a set of parameters theta, paying much more attention to fitting the \\npoints close by accurately. Whereas ignoring the contribution from faraway points. \\nOkay? Yeah?  \\nStudent:Your Y is exponentially [inaudible]?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Yeah. Let’s see. So it turns out there are many other weighting \\nfunctions you can use. It turns out that there are definitely different communities of \\nresearchers that tend to choose different choices by default. There is somewhat of a \\nliterature on debating what point – exactly what function to use. This, sort of, exponential \\ndecay function is – this happens to be a reasonably common one that seems to be a more \\nreasonable choice on many problems, but you can actually plug in other functions as \\nwell. Did I mention what [inaudible] is it at? For those of you that are familiar with the \\nnormal distribution, or the Gaussian distribution, say this – what this formula I’ve written \\nout here, it cosmetically looks a bit like a Gaussian distribution. Okay? But this actually \\nhas absolutely nothing to do with Gaussian distribution. So this is not that a problem with \\nXI is Gaussian or whatever. This is no such interpretation. This is just a convenient \\nfunction that happens to be a bell-shaped function, but don’t endow this of any Gaussian \\nsemantics. Okay?'),\n",

Okay? And so training examples that are really far away get a very \\nsmall weight.  \\nOne last small generalization to this is that normally there’s one other parameter to this \\nalgorithm, which I’ll denote as tow. Again, this looks suspiciously like the variants of a \\nGaussian, but this is not a Gaussian. This is a convenient form or function. This \\nparameter tow is called the bandwidth parameter and informally it controls how fast the \\nweights fall of with distance. Okay? So just copy my diagram from the other side, I \\nguess. So if tow is very small, if that’s a query X, then you end up choosing a fairly \\nnarrow Gaussian – excuse me, a fairly narrow bell shape, so that the weights of the points \\nare far away fall off rapidly. Whereas if tow is large then you’d end up choosing a \\nweighting function that falls of relatively slowly with distance from your query. Okay?  \\nSo I hope you can, therefore, see that if you apply locally weighted linear regression to a \\ndata set that looks like this, then to ask what your hypothesis output is at a point like this \\nyou end up having a straight line making that prediction. To ask what kind of class this \\n[inaudible] at that value you put a straight line there and you predict that value. It turns \\nout that every time you try to vary your hypothesis, every time you ask your learning \\nalgorithm to make a prediction for how much a new house costs or whatever, you need to \\nrun a new fitting procedure and then evaluate this line that you fit just at the position of \\nthe value of X. So the position of the query where you’re trying to make a prediction. \\nOkay? But if you do this for every point along the X-axis then you find that locally \\nweighted regression is able to trace on this, sort of, very non-linear curve for a data set \\nlike this. Okay?  \\nSo in the problem set we’re actually gonna let you play around more with this algorithm. \\nSo I won’t say too much more about it here. But to finally move on to the next topic let \\nme check the questions you have. Yeah?  \\nStudent:It seems like you still have the same problem of overfitting and underfitting, like \\nwhen you had a Q’s tow. Like you make it too small in your –  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Yes, absolutely. Yes. So locally weighted regression can run \\ninto – locally weighted regression is not a penancier for the problem of overfitting or \\nunderfitting. You can still run into the same problems with locally weighted regression. \\nWhat you just said about – and so some of these things I’ll leave you to discover for \\nyourself in the homework problem. You’ll actually see what you just mentioned. Yeah?  \\nStudent:It almost seems like you’re not even thoroughly [inaudible] with this locally \\nweighted, you had all the data that you originally had anyway.'),\n",

So the question is, sort of, this – it’s almost as if you’re \\nnot building a model, because you need the entire data set. And the other way of saying \\nthat is that this is a non-parametric learning algorithm. So this –I don’t know. I won’t \\ndebate whether, you know, are we really building a model or not. But this is a perfectly \\nfine – so if I think when you write a code implementing locally weighted linear \\nregression on the data set I think of that code as a whole – as building your model. So it \\nactually uses – we’ve actually used this quite successfully to model, sort of, the dynamics \\nof this autonomous helicopter this is. Yeah?  \\nStudent:I ask if this algorithm that learn the weights based on the data?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Learn what weights? Oh, the weights WI.  \\nStudent:Instead of using [inaudible].  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):I see, yes. So it turns out there are a few things you can do. One \\nthing that is quite common is how to choose this band with parameter tow, right? As \\nusing the data. We’ll actually talk about that a bit later when we talk about model \\nselection. Yes? One last question.  \\nStudent:I used [inaudible] Gaussian sometimes if you [inaudible] Gaussian and then –  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Oh, I guess. Lt’s see. Boy. The weights are not random \\nvariables and it’s not, for the purpose of this algorithm, it is not useful to endow it with \\nprobable semantics. So you could choose to define things as Gaussian, but it, sort of, \\ndoesn’t lead anywhere. In fact, it turns out that I happened to choose this, sort of, bell-\\nshaped function to define my weights. It’s actually fine to choose a function that doesn’t \\neven integrate to one, that integrates to infinity, say, as you’re weighting function. So in \\nthat sense, I mean, you could force in the definition of a Gaussian, but it’s, sort of, not \\nuseful. Especially since you use other functions that integrate to infinity and don’t \\nintegrate to one. Okay? It’s the last question and let’s move on  \\nStudent:Assume that we have a very huge [inaudible], for example. A very huge set of \\nhouses and want to predict the linear for each house and so should the end result for each \\ninput – I’m seeing this very constantly for –  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Yes, you’re right. So because locally weighted regression is a \\nnon-parametric algorithm every time you make a prediction you need to fit theta to your \\nentire training set again. So you’re actually right. If you have a very large training set \\nthen this is a somewhat expensive algorithm to use. Because every time you want to \\nmake a prediction you need to fit a straight line to a huge data set again.

That’s not something I want to go into today. Okay? Let me move one. \\nLet’s take more questions later.  \\nSo, okay. So that’s locally weighted regression. Remember the outline I had, I guess, at \\nthe beginning of this lecture. What I want to do now is talk about a probabilistic \\ninterpretation of linear regression, all right? And in particular of the – it’ll be this \\nprobabilistic interpretation that let’s us move on to talk about logistic regression, which \\nwill be our first classification algorithm. So let’s put aside locally weighted regression for \\nnow. We’ll just talk about ordinary unweighted linear regression. Let’s ask the question \\nof why least squares, right? Of all the things we could optimize how do we come up with \\nthis criteria for minimizing the square of the area between the predictions of the \\nhypotheses and the values Y predicted. So why not minimize the absolute value of the \\nareas or the areas to the power of four or something? What I’m going to do now is \\npresent one set of assumptions that will serve to “justify” why we’re minimizing the sum \\nof square zero. Okay?  \\nIt turns out that there are many assumptions that are sufficient to justify why we do least \\nsquares and this is just one of them. So just because I present one set of assumptions \\nunder which least squares regression make sense, but this is not the only set of \\nassumptions. So even if the assumptions I describe don’t hold, least squares actually still \\nmakes sense in many circumstances. But this sort of new help, you know, give one \\nrationalization, like, one reason for doing least squares regression. And, in particular, \\nwhat I’m going to do is endow the least squares model with probabilistic semantics. So \\nlet’s assume in our example of predicting housing prices, that the price of the house it’s \\nsold four, and there’s going to be some linear function of the features, plus some term \\nepsilon I. Okay? And epsilon I will be our error term. You can think of the error term as \\ncapturing unmodeled effects, like, that maybe there’s some other features of a house, like, \\nmaybe how many fireplaces it has or whether there’s a garden or whatever, that there are \\nadditional features that we jut fail to capture or you can think of epsilon as random noise. \\nEpsilon is our error term that captures both these unmodeled effects. Just things we forgot \\nto model. Maybe the function isn’t quite linear or something. As well as random noise, \\nlike maybe that day the seller was in a really bad mood and so he sold it, just refused to \\ngo for a reasonable price or something. And now I will assume that the errors have a \\nprobabilistic – have a probability distribution. I’ll assume that the errors epsilon I are \\ndistributed just till they denote epsilon I is distributive according to a probability \\ndistribution. That’s a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance sigma squared. \\nOkay? So let me just scripts in here, n stands for normal, right? To denote a normal \\ndistribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, with mean zero and covariance \\nsigma squared.  \\nActually, just quickly raise your hand if you’ve seen a Gaussian distribution before. \\nOkay, cool. Most of you. Great. Almost everyone. So, in other words, the density for \\nGaussian is what you’ve seen before. The density for epsilon I would be one over root 2 \\npi sigma, E to the negative, epsilon I squared over 2 sigma squared, right? And the'),\n",

In other words, saying goes as that the price of a house given the features \\nof the house and my parameters theta, this is going to be a random variable that’s \\ndistributed Gaussian with mean theta transpose XI and variance sigma squared. Right? \\nBecause we imagine that the way the housing prices are generated is that the price of a \\nhouse is equal to theta transpose XI and then plus some random Gaussian noise with \\nvariance sigma squared.

Lots of you.  \\nIn point of notation – oh, yes?  \\nStudent:Assuming we don’t know anything about the error, why do you assume here the \\nerror is a Gaussian?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Right. So, boy. Why do I see the error as Gaussian? Two \\nreasons, right? One is that it turns out to be mathematically convenient to do so and the \\nother is, I don’t know, I can also mumble about justifications, such as things to the central \\nlimit theorem. It turns out that if you, for the vast majority of problems, if you apply a \\nlinear regression model like this and try to measure the distribution of the errors, not all \\nthe time, but very often you find that the errors really are Gaussian. That this Gaussian \\nmodel is a good assumption for the error in regression problems like these. Some of you \\nmay have heard of the central limit theorem, which says that the sum of many \\nindependent random variables will tend towards a Gaussian. So if the error is caused by \\nmany effects, like the mood of the seller, the mood of the buyer, some other features that \\nwe miss, whether the place has a garden or not, and if all of these effects are independent, \\nthen by the central limit theorem you might be inclined to believe that the sum of all \\nthese effects will be approximately Gaussian. If in practice, I guess, the two real answers \\nare that, 1.) In practice this is actually a reasonably accurate assumption, and 2.) Is it \\nturns out to be mathematically convenient to do so. Okay? Yeah?  \\nStudent:It seems like we’re saying if we assume that area around model has zero mean, \\nthen the area is centered around our model. Which it seems almost like we’re trying to \\nassume what we’re trying to prove. Instructor? \\nThat’s the [inaudible] but, yes. You are assuming that the error has zero mean. Which is, \\nyeah, right. I think later this quarter we get to some of the other things, but for now just \\nthink of this as a mathematically – it’s actually not an unreasonable assumption. I guess, \\nin machine learning all the assumptions we make are almost never true in the absence \\nsense, right? Because, for instance, housing prices are priced to dollars and cents, so the \\nerror will be – errors in prices are not continued as value random variables, because \\nhouses can only be priced at a certain number of dollars and a certain number of cents \\nand you never have fractions of cents in housing prices.

So in that sense, assumptions we make are never “absolutely true,” but \\nfor practical purposes this is a accurate enough assumption that it’ll be useful to make. \\nOkay? I think in a week or two, we’ll actually come back to selected more about the \\nassumptions we make and when they help our learning algorithms and when they hurt our \\nlearning algorithms. We’ll say a bit more about it when we talk about generative and \\ndiscriminative learning algorithms, like, in a week or two. Okay?  \\nSo let’s point out one bit of notation, which is that when I wrote this down I actually \\nwrote P of YI given XI and then semicolon theta and I’m going to use this notation when \\nwe are not thinking of theta as a random variable. So in statistics, though, sometimes it’s \\ncalled the frequentist’s point of view, where you think of there as being some, sort of, \\ntrue value of theta that’s out there that’s generating the data say, but we don’t know what \\ntheta is, but theta is not a random vehicle, right? So it’s not like there’s some random \\nvalue of theta out there. It’s that theta is – there’s some true value of theta out there. It’s \\njust that we don’t know what the true value of theta is. So if theta is not a random \\nvariable, then I’m going to avoid writing P of YI given XI comma theta, because this \\nwould mean that probably of YI conditioned on X and theta and you can only condition \\non random variables. So at this part of the class where we’re taking sort of frequentist’s \\nviewpoint rather than the Dasian viewpoint, in this part of class we’re thinking of theta \\nnot as a random variable, but just as something we’re trying to estimate and use the \\nsemicolon notation. So the way to read this is this is the probability of YI given XI and \\nparameterized by theta. Okay? So you read the semicolon as parameterized by. And in \\nthe same way here, I’ll say YI given XI parameterized by theta is distributed Gaussian \\nwith that.  \\nAll right. So we’re gonna make one more assumption. Let’s assume that the error terms \\nare IID, okay? Which stands for Independently and Identically Distributed. So it’s going \\nto assume that the error terms are independent of each other, right? The identically \\ndistributed part just means that I’m assuming the outcome for the same Gaussian \\ndistribution or the same variance, but the more important part of is this is that I’m \\nassuming that the epsilon I’s are independent of each other. Now, let’s talk about how to \\nfit a model. The probability of Y given X parameterized by theta – I’m actually going to \\ngive this another name. I’m going to write this down and we’ll call this the likelihood of \\ntheta as the probability of Y given X parameterized by theta. And so this is going to be \\nthe product over my training set like that. Which is, in turn, going to be a product of those \\nGaussian densities that I wrote down just now, right? Okay?  \\nThen in parts of notation, I guess, I define this term here to be the likelihood of theta. \\nAnd the likely of theta is just the probability of the data Y, right? Given X and prioritized \\nby theta. To test the likelihood and probability are often confused. So the likelihood of \\ntheta is the same thing as the probability of the data you saw. So likely and probably are, \\nsort of, the same thing. Except that when I use the term likelihood I’m trying to \\nemphasize that I’m taking this thing and viewing it as a function of theta. Okay? So \\nlikelihood and for probability, they’re really the same thing except that when I want to \\nview this thing as a function of theta holding X and Y fix are then called likelihood. \\nOkay? So hopefully you hear me say the likelihood of the parameters and the probability'),\n",

So given a training set, what \\nparameters theta do you want to choose for your model? Well, the principle of maximum \\nlikelihood estimation says that, right? You can choose the value of theta that makes the \\ndata as probable as possible, right? So choose theta to maximize the likelihood.

So maximizing the likelihood or maximizing the log likelihood is the same as \\nminimizing that term over there. Well, you get it, right? Because there’s a minus sign. So \\nmaximizing this because of the minus sign is the same as minimizing this as a function of \\ntheta. And this is, of course, just the same quadratic cos function that we had last time, J \\nof theta, right? So what we’ve just shown is that the ordinary least squares algorithm, that \\nwe worked on the previous lecture, is just maximum likelihood assuming this \\nprobabilistic model, assuming IID Gaussian errors on our data. Okay?  \\nOne thing that we’ll actually leave is that, in the next lecture notice that the value of \\nsigma squared doesn’t matter, right? That somehow no matter what the value of sigma \\nsquared is, I mean, sigma squared has to be a positive number. It’s a variance of a \\nGaussian. So that no matter what sigma squared is since it’s a positive number the value \\nof theta we end up with will be the same, right? So because minimizing this you get the \\nsame value of theta no matter what sigma squared is. So it’s as if in this model the value \\nof sigma squared doesn’t really matter. Just remember that for the next lecture. We’ll \\ncome back to this again. Any questions about this? Actually, let me clean up another \\ncouple of boards and then I’ll see what questions you have.  \\nOkay. Any questions? Yeah?  \\nStudent:You are, I think here you try to measure the likelihood of your nice of theta by a \\nfraction of error, but I think it’s that you measure because it depends on the family of \\ntheta too, for example. If you have a lot of parameters [inaudible] or fitting in?'),\n",

I mean, you’re asking about overfitting, whether \\nthis is a good model. I think let’s – the thing’s you’re mentioning are maybe deeper \\nquestions about learning algorithms that we’ll just come back to later, so don’t really \\nwant to get into that right now. Any more questions? Okay.  \\nSo this endows linear regression with a probabilistic interpretation. I’m actually going to \\nuse this probabil – use this, sort of, probabilistic interpretation in order to derive our next \\nlearning algorithm, which will be our first classification algorithm. Okay? So you’ll recall \\nthat I said that regression problems are where the variable Y that you’re trying to predict \\nis continuous values. Now I’m actually gonna talk about our first classification problem, \\nwhere the value Y you’re trying to predict will be discreet value. You can take on only a \\nsmall number of discrete values and in this case I’ll talk about binding classification \\nwhere Y takes on only two values, right? So you come up with classification problems if \\nyou’re trying to do, say, a medical diagnosis and try to decide based on some features that \\nthe patient has a disease or does not have a disease. Or if in the housing example, maybe \\nyou’re trying to decide will this house sell in the next six months or not and the answer is \\neither yes or no. It’ll either be sold in the next six months or it won’t be. Other standing \\nexamples, if you want to build a spam filter. Is this e-mail spam or not? It’s yes or no. Or \\nif you, you know, some of my colleagues sit in whether predicting whether a computer \\nsystem will crash. So you have a learning algorithm to predict will this computing cluster \\ncrash over the next 24 hours? And, again, it’s a yes or no answer.  \\nSo there’s X, there’s Y. And in a classification problem Y takes on two values, zero and \\none. That’s it in binding the classification. So what can you do? Well, one thing you \\ncould do is take linear regression, as we’ve described it so far, and apply it to this \\nproblem, right? So you, you know, given this data set you can fit a straight line to it. \\nMaybe you get that straight line, right? But this data set I’ve drawn, right? This is an \\namazingly easy classification problem. It’s pretty obvious to all of us that, right? The \\nrelationship between X and Y is – well, you just look at a value around here and it’s the \\nright is one, it’s the left and Y is zero. So you apply linear regressions to this data set and \\nyou get a reasonable fit and you can then maybe take your linear regression hypothesis to \\nthis straight line and threshold it at 0.5. If you do that you’ll certainly get the right \\nanswer. You predict that if X is to the right of, sort of, the mid-point here then Y is one \\nand then next to the left of that mid-point then Y is zero.  \\nSo some people actually do this. Apply linear regression to classification problems and \\nsometimes it’ll work okay, but in general it’s actually a pretty bad idea to apply linear \\nregression to classification problems like these and here’s why. Let’s say I change my \\ntraining set by giving you just one more training example all the way up there, right? \\nImagine if given this training set is actually still entirely obvious what the relationship \\nbetween X and Y is, right? It’s just – take this value as greater than Y is one and it’s less \\nthen Y is zero. By giving you this additional training example it really shouldn’t change \\nanything. I mean, I didn’t really convey much new information. There’s no surprise that \\nthis corresponds to Y equals one. But if you now fit linear regression to this data set you \\nend up with a line that, I don’t know, maybe looks like that, right? And now the'),\n",

But the point of this is that there’s not a deep \\nmeaning to this. The point of this is just that it could be a really bad idea to apply linear \\nregression to classification algorithm. Sometimes it work fine, but usually I wouldn’t do \\nit. So a couple of problems with this. One is that, well – so what do you want to do for \\nclassification? If you know the value of Y lies between zero and one then to kind of fix \\nthis problem let’s just start by changing the form of our hypothesis so that my hypothesis \\nalways lies in the unit interval between zero and one. Okay? So if I know Y is either zero \\nor one then let’s at least not have my hypothesis predict values much larger than one and \\nmuch smaller than zero. And so I’m going to – instead of choosing a linear function for \\nmy hypothesis I’m going to choose something slightly different. And, in particular, I’m \\ngoing to choose this function, H subscript theta of X is going to equal to G of theta \\ntranspose X where G is going to be this function and so this becomes more than one plus \\ntheta X of theta transpose X. And G of Z is called the sigmoid function and it is often also \\ncalled the logistic function. It goes by either of these names.  \\nAnd what G of Z looks like is the following. So when you have your horizontal axis I’m \\ngoing to plot Z and so G of Z will look like this. Okay? I didn’t draw that very well. \\nOkay. So G of Z tends towards zero as Z becomes very small and G of Z will ascend \\ntowards one as Z becomes large and it crosses the vertical axis at 0.5. So this is what \\nsigmoid function, also called the logistic function of. Yeah? Question?  \\nStudent:What sort of sigmoid in other step five?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Say that again.  \\nStudent:Why we cannot chose this at five for some reason, like, that’s better binary.'),\n",

Let me come back to that later. So it turns out that Y – \\nwhere did I get this function from, right? I just wrote down this function. It actually turns \\nout that there are two reasons for using this function that we’ll come to. One is – we \\ntalked about generalized linear models. We’ll see that this falls out naturally as part of the \\nbroader class of models. And another reason that we’ll talk about next week, it turns out \\nthere are a couple of, I think, very beautiful reasons for why we choose logistic functions. \\nWe’ll see that in a little bit. But for now let me just define it and just take my word for it \\nfor now that this is a reasonable choice. Okay? But notice now that my – the values \\noutput by my hypothesis will always be between zero and one. Furthermore, just like we \\ndid for linear regression, I’m going to endow the outputs and my hypothesis with a \\nprobabilistic interpretation, right? So I’m going to assume that the probability that Y is \\nequal to one given X and parameterized by theta that’s equal to H subscript theta of X, all \\nright? So in other words I’m going to imagine that my hypothesis is outputting all these \\nnumbers that lie between zero and one. I’m going to think of my hypothesis as trying to \\nestimate the probability that Y is equal to one. Okay? And because Y has to be either zero \\nor one then the probability of Y equals zero is going to be that. All right? So more simply \\nit turns out – actually, take these two equations and write them more compactly. Write P \\nof Y given X parameterized by theta. This is going to be H subscript theta of X to the \\npower of Y times one minus H of X to the power of one minus Y. Okay?  \\nSo I know this looks somewhat bizarre, but this actually makes the variation much nicer. \\nSo Y is equal to one then this equation is H of X to the power of one times something to \\nthe power of zero. So anything to the power of zero is just one, right? So Y equals one \\nthen this is something to the power of zero and so this is just one. So if Y equals one this \\nis just saying P of Y equals one is equal to H subscript theta of X. Okay? And in the same \\nway, if Y is equal to zero then this is P of Y equals zero equals this thing to the power of \\nzero and so this disappears. This is just one times this thing power of one. Okay? So this \\nis a compact way of writing both of these equations to gather them to one line. So let’s \\nhope our parameter fitting, right? And, again, you can ask – well, given this model by \\ndata, how do I fit the parameters theta of my model? So the likelihood of the parameters \\nis, as before, it’s just the probability of theta, right? Which is product over I, PFYI given \\nXI parameterized by theta. Which is – just plugging those in. Okay? I dropped this theta \\nsubscript just so you can write a little bit less. Oh, excuse me. These should be XI’s and \\nYI’s. Okay?  \\nSo, as before, let’s say we want to find a maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters \\ntheta. So we want to find the – setting the parameters theta that maximizes the likelihood \\nL of theta. It turns out that very often – just when you work with the derivations, it turns \\nout that it is often much easier to maximize the log of the likelihood rather than maximize \\nthe likelihood. So the log likelihood L of theta is just log of capital L. This will, therefore, \\nbe sum of this. Okay? And so to fit the parameters theta of our model we’ll find the value \\nof theta that maximizes this log likelihood. Yeah?  \\nStudent:[Inaudible]  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Say that again.'),\n",

Thanks. So having maximized this function – well, it \\nturns out we can actually apply the same gradient descent algorithm that we learned. That \\nwas the first algorithm we used to minimize the quadratic function. And you remember, \\nwhen we talked about least squares, the first algorithm we used to minimize the quadratic \\nerror function was great in descent. So can actually use exactly the same algorithm to \\nmaximize the log likelihood. And you remember, that algorithm was just repeatedly take \\nthe value of theta and you replace it with the previous value of theta plus a learning rate \\nalpha times the gradient of the cos function. The log likelihood will respect the theta. \\nOkay? One small change is that because previously we were trying to minimize the \\nquadratic error term. Today we’re trying to maximize rather than minimize. So rather \\nthan having a minus sign we have a plus sign. So this is just great in ascents, but for the \\nmaximization rather than the minimization. So we actually call this gradient ascent and \\nit’s really the same algorithm.  \\nSo to figure out what this gradient – so in order to derive gradient descent, what you need \\nto do is compute the partial derivatives of your objective function with respect to each of \\nyour parameters theta I, right? It turns out that if you actually compute this partial \\nderivative – so you take this formula, this L of theta, which is – oh, got that wrong too. If \\nyou take this lower case l theta, if you take the log likelihood of theta, and if you take it’s \\npartial derivative with respect to theta I you find that this is equal to – let’s see. Okay? \\nAnd, I don’t know, the derivation isn’t terribly complicated, but in the interest of saving \\nyou watching me write down a couple of blackboards full of math I’ll just write down the \\nfinal answer. But the way you get this is you just take those, plug in the definition for F \\nsubscript theta as function of XI, and take derivatives, and work through the algebra it \\nturns out it’ll simplify down to this formula. Okay?  \\nAnd so what that gives you is that gradient ascent is the following rule. Theta J gets \\nupdated as theta J plus alpha gives this. Okay? Does this look familiar to anyone? Did \\nyou remember seeing this formula at the last lecture? Right. So when I worked up \\nBastrian descent for least squares regression I, actually, wrote down exactly the same \\nthing, or maybe there’s a minus sign and this is also fit. But I, actually, had exactly the \\nsame learning rule last time for least squares regression, right? Is this the same learning \\nalgorithm then? So what’s different? How come I was making all that noise earlier about \\nleast squares regression being a bad idea for classification problems and then I did a \\nbunch of math and I skipped some steps, but I’m, sort of, claiming at the end they’re \\nreally the same learning algorithm?  \\nStudent:[Inaudible] constants?  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Say that again.  \\nStudent:[Inaudible]  \\nInstructor (Andrew Ng):Oh, right.

The \\ndefinition of this H subscript theta of XI is not the same as the definition I was using in \\nthe previous lecture. And in particular this is no longer theta transpose XI. This is not a \\nlinear function anymore. This is a logistic function of theta transpose XI. Okay? So even \\nthough this looks cosmetically similar, even though this is similar on the surface, to the \\nBastrian descent rule I derived last time for least squares regression this is actually a \\ntotally different learning algorithm. Okay? And it turns out that there’s actually no \\ncoincidence that you ended up with the same learning rule. We’ll actually talk a bit more \\nabout this later when we talk about generalized linear models. But this is one of the most \\nelegant generalized learning models that we’ll see later. That even though we’re using a \\ndifferent model, you actually ended up with what looks like the same learning algorithm \\nand it’s actually no coincidence. Cool.  \\nOne last comment as part of a sort of learning process, over here I said I take the \\nderivatives and I ended up with this line. I didn’t want to make you sit through a long \\nalgebraic derivation, but later today or later this week, please, do go home and look at our \\nlecture notes, where I wrote out the entirety of this derivation in full, and make sure you \\ncan follow every single step of how we take partial derivatives of this log likelihood to \\nget this formula over here. Okay? By the way, for those who are interested in seriously \\nmasking machine learning material, when you go home and look at the lecture notes it \\nwill actually be very easy for most of you to look through the lecture notes and read \\nthrough every line and go yep, that makes sense, that makes sense, that makes sense, and, \\nsort of, say cool. I see how you get this line. You want to make sure you really \\nunderstand the material. My concrete suggestion to you would be to you to go home, read \\nthrough the lecture notes, check every line, and then to cover up the derivation and see if \\nyou can derive this example, right? So in general, that’s usually good advice for studying \\ntechnical material like machine learning. Which is if you work through a proof and you \\nthink you understood every line, the way to make sure you really understood it is to cover \\nit up and see if you can rederive the entire thing itself. This is actually a great way \\nbecause I did this a lot when I was trying to study various pieces of machine learning \\ntheory and various proofs. And this is actually a great way to study because cover up the \\nderivations and see if you can do it yourself without looking at the original derivation. All \\nright.  \\nI probably won’t get to Newton’s Method today. I just want to say – take one quick \\ndigression to talk about one more algorithm, which was the discussion sort of alluding to \\nthis earlier, which is the perceptron algorithm, right? So I’m not gonna say a whole lot \\nabout the perceptron algorithm, but this is something that we’ll come back to later. Later \\nthis quarter we’ll talk about learning theory. So in logistic regression we said that G of Z \\nare, sort of, my hypothesis output values that were low numbers between zero and one. \\nThe question is what if you want to force G of Z to up the value to either zero one? So the \\nperceptron algorithm defines G of Z to be this. So the picture is – or the cartoon is, rather \\nthan this sigmoid function. E of Z now looks like this step function that you were asking'),\n",

In saying this before, we can use H subscript theta of X equals G of theta \\ntranspose X. Okay? So this is actually – everything is exactly the same as before, except \\nthat G of Z is now the step function. It turns out there’s this learning called the perceptron \\nlearning rule that’s actually even the same as the classic gradient ascent for logistic \\nregression. And the learning rule is given by this. Okay? So it looks just like the classic \\ngradient ascent rule for logistic regression. So this is very different flavor of algorithm \\nthan least squares regression and logistic regression, and, in particular, because it outputs \\nonly values are either zero or one it turns out it’s very difficult to endow this algorithm \\nwith probabilistic semantics. And this is, again, even though – oh, excuse me. Right \\nthere. Okay. And even though this learning rule looks, again, looks cosmetically very \\nsimilar to what we have in logistics regression this is actually a very different type of \\nlearning rule than the others that were seen in this class. So because this is such a simple \\nlearning algorithm, right? It just computes theta transpose X and then you threshold and \\nthen your output is zero or one. This is – right. So these are a simpler algorithm than \\nlogistic regression, I think. When we talk about learning theory later in this class, the \\nsimplicity of this algorithm will let us come back and use it as a building block. Okay? \\nBut that’s all I want to say about this algorithm for now.  \\nJust for fun, the last thing I’ll do today is show you a historical video with – that talks \\nabout the perceptron algorithm. This particular video comes from a video series titled The \\nMachine that Changed The World and was produced WGBH Television in cooperation \\nwith the BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, and it aired on PBS a few years ago. \\nThis shows you what machine learning used to be like. It’s a fun clip on perceptron \\nalgorithm.  \\nIn the 1950’s and 60’s scientists built a few working perceptrons, as these artificial brains \\nwere called. He’s using it to explore the mysterious problem of how the brain learns. This \\nperceptron is being trained to recognize the difference between males and females. It is \\nsomething that all of us can do easily, but few of us can explain how. To get a computer \\nto do this it would involve working out many complex rules about faces and writing a \\ncomputer program, but this perceptron was simply given lots and lots of examples, \\nincluding some with unusual hairstyles. But when it comes to a beetle the computer looks \\nat facial features and hair outline and takes longer to learn what it’s told by Dr. Taylor. \\nAndrew puts on his wig also causes a little part searching. After training on lots of \\nexamples, it’s given new faces it has never seen and is able to successfully distinguish \\nmale from female. It has learned.  \\nAll right. Isn’t that great? Okay.
