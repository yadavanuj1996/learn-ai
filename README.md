# Learn AI Path

# 🧠 AI Pivot Roadmap for Software Engineer → AI Product Builder

Welcome to my learning journey as I transition from a senior software engineer to an AI-equipped engineer, with the goal of building AI-powered products and startups — starting with the **fitness domain**, **developer tools**, and solving problems across sectors.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- ✅ Transition into hands-on AI roles
- ✅ Build and launch AI-driven products
- ✅ Learn by building — project-first, theory later
- ✅ Avoid long, academic courses that drain motivation

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Launch Fast with AI Foundations (Week 1)

### 🧪 Build an LLM-powered app in under 2 hours
- [x] [LangChain + OpenAI: Chat with Your Data](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/)
  - Learn how to create a chatbot that answers questions from your own docs using OpenAI + LangChain
  - Outcome: ✅ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) MVP

---

## 🧩 Phase 1.5: MCP Crash Course & Mini Project

### 📺 MCP Crash Course for Python Developers – *Dave Ebbelaar (YouTube)*
- [x] Completed: Built and dockerized a full MCP workflow (Server + FastAPI Client)
- [x] Project: **MCP-Powered Math Calculator**
  - Created a custom MCP Server that exposes a simple calculator tool
  - Built a Python-based FastAPI client that calls the MCP server
  - Ran MCP server with Docker containers and called it from my local client using http-streamable for isolated local testing.
- Outcome: ✅ Understood MCP architecture (tools/resources), Docker-based service design, and FastAPI integration
---

## 🧠 Phase 2: LLM Project Engineering with Custom Builds

**Primary Course:**  
- [ ] [LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-large-language-models-agents/)  
⏱️ Estimated Time: 3–5 weeks | 💰 ~5–10 USD API usage | 🛠️ Project-First + Deployment Focus

---

### ✅ Core Skills Covered
- LangChain (Chains, Memory, Agents, Tools)
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- OpenAI & Open-Source LLMs
- Tool Calling / Agents
- LoRA Fine-Tuning
- Deployment via FastAPI or Streamlit
- Building full-stack LLM-powered applications

---

### 🚀 My Custom Project Checklist

| ✅ | Project | Description |
|----|---------|-------------|
| [ ] | **Personalized Fitness Plan Generator** | Replace brochure generator: uses LLM to recommend daily/weekly workouts and diet based on goals. |
| [ ] | **Fitness Content Summarizer** | Replace meeting summarizer: summarize YouTube fitness podcasts/transcripts into action plans. |
| [ ] | **Dev Tool AI Assistant** | Replace customer support bot: lets users ask questions about CI/CD or GitHub repo setup. |
| [ ] | **Code Converter & Explainer** | Replace code translation agent: converts Bash ↔ PowerShell, explains Docker commands, etc. |
| [ ] | **RAG over Personal Docs (Fitness/Dev)** | Replace document Q&A assistant: ask questions over your fitness tracking logs or project docs. |
| [ ] | **Fine-Tuned Fitness Coach** | Replace LoRA fine-tuner: use LoRA to tune open-source model on fitness Reddit threads or gym logs. |
| [ ] | **Smart Agent (Fitness or SaaS Taskbot)** | Replace BabyAGI/BabyGPT: agent automates task chaining (e.g., planning workout & logging it). |
| [ ] | **Deploy AI Tool (FastAPI preferred)** | Replace generic app deploy: build and deploy one of above tools as a shareable product. |

### Other Ideas that you can work on
- Resume Chatbot
  - A simple application that takes pdfs of resumes as input, and on the basis of documents a HR user can ask questions and shortlist suitable candidates.
  - The user can ask about qualifications, projects, experience etc.
